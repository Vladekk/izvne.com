<p>Появился повод любить проект Piano Magic ещё больше.</p> <p>Песня "Марш атеистов"</p>Слушать: <br> <br><a href="/files/t/bfbc.mp3">Скачать MP3</a>  <p>Ничего так разжигает, хоть можно было и погуще.</p> <p>Well I can accept that you have your faith<br>So you must accept that I have none<br>You chase your god into your grave<br>I'll die alone when my days are done<br>All these fabulous beasts that you strike down<br>All this beautiful land that you claim to command<br>And all these wars in the name of a book<br>There's god in your heart but there's blood on your hands<br><br>So where are you fires of hell<br>So where now your golden gates<br>I see no angels, no heaven on high<br>I hear no marching of your saints<br>Go placidly amongst the noise and haste<br><br>[ Piano Magic Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ] <br>Well, I know your churches are a sight to behold<br>And I know your stories as good as any man<br>I know we all have our crosses to bear<br>But I?ll waste none of my time in desperate prayer<br>I've rung the bells of the Mont St-Michel<br>But me and the saviour were never that close<br>I've called into the night with no hope of reply<br>But I?ve seen the holes in the holy ghost<br><br>So where now, your peace to all men<br>So where now, your undeniable proof<br>Where is it written, in paper or stone<br>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth</p>
