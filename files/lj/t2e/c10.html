Chapter 10<br>
Good Friends Along the Way I
</b>
</center>
<p>
Some of the richest rewards that ensue from pursuing psychedelic exploration with close 
friends comes from the deep, richly satisfying relationships that develop.  
<p>
Relationships deepen by way of a two-pronged dynamic.  First there is the clearing of 
individual beings -- the dissolving away of repressed material, the recognizing and dropping of 
outdated concepts and habits, the dropping of defenses.  This opens the space among 
participants and allows an increasing intimacy.  As the barriers dissolve, the energy radiated 
from each person increases.  The combined linking of these radiant sources yields a strong 
energy field, a field of bonding love that supports and strengthens each one in the group. 
<p>
The other prong consists in exploring new areas of consciousness, which brings into the 
group a wealth of new information.  Each of course apprehends this in his/her own, unique 
way.  The sharing and discussion of such discoveries leads to greater clarification and 
understanding in each member of the group.  The issues go all the way from personal 
dynamics to the nature of God and how one achieves and maintains transcendence.  
<p>
This chapter and the following one are devoted to material gathered from explorations 
and exchanges with good friends.

<i>Duncan</i>
</center>
<p>
One of the fascinating, significant figures in the early days of psychedelics was a 
psychologist in Canada.  In the early 1950's, when LSD was first introduced, investigators 
were busily engaged in determining the nature of this substance and the results it produced.  
The medical establishment rapidly arrived at the conclusion that LSD produces a state which 
mimicked psychosis, and named it a psychotomimetic.  
<p>
Fortunately there were others who because of some combination of having an 
appropriate world view, being completely at peace with themselves, having a lively curiosity 
and a willingness to relinquish preconceived ideas, were able to move into completely different 
areas of experience with these substances.  
<p>
Duncan was one of these.  Although a brilliant psychologist, he was an extremely 
lovable, fun-loving person.  When he and Al Hubbard came together there was instant rapport.  
They recognized each other as scoundrels and explorers, and immediately formed a deep 
alliance.  The following excerpts of a letter from Duncan to Al gives the flavor of their 
relationship: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Hello you old goat! 
<p>
Whose old uncle forgets him and never, never writes him a letter?  My 
uncle Al - that's who.
<p>
What are they doing to you these days that you neglect your fat nephew?  
I've been watching the incoming mail, meeting all the aircraft and reading the 
police news regularly in hopes that I'd catch some glimpse of a letter from you, 
yourself, or your name in headlines.  However, despite my vigilance there 
hasn't been the slightest indication that you are still alive.  If I didn't know that 
it would take a battalion of enraged grizzly bears to do you in, I'd have been so 
worried I wouldn't sleep by now.
<p>
There is another picture that floats through my mind however - in fact a 
whole series of pictures of Al basking in the sunshine of some Pacific Isle, 
watching ball games in Witchita, catching huge fish off Boca Grande and 
generally living a life of idle bliss. . .
<p>
How's about a few lines of communication to let me know if we still fly the 
same flag - and what the latest developments have been.  
<p>
All the very best of good wishes.  May the sound of police whistles cease to 
annoy you and become music to your ears.
</div>
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 200">
Love,<br>
Dunc.
</div>
<p>
With Al's companionship, Duncan freely explored vast areas of consciousness with wise 
comprehension.  Hubbard was fond of carrying around a little tape recorder playing back a 
statement that Duncan pronounced during one of his explorations.  It ended with the statement:  
"The true meaning of life is so simple that scientists will never discover it." 
<p>
I heard many stories about Duncan from Hubbard.  Duncan had many gifts and talents, 
including the Irish ability to eloquently describe the multifarious situations he often found 
himself in.  And his ability to creatively resolve them.
<p>
Duncan was quite enthused about the worlds that LSD opened up and the enormous 
potential such experiences held for the betterment of mankind.  Consequently at one 
psychological meeting where he presented a paper, he recommended that LSD should be 
available in gum-ball machines in every drugstore.  While current American society is shocked 
by such a suggestion, it must be remembered that at that time LSD was being used very 
successfully in several areas in Canada as a treatment for alcoholism.  Saskatchewan was one 
of the few places in time and geography when the man on the street recognized LSD as a 
valuable medicine, and that its use was the most effective treatment for alcoholism then 
known.  As alcoholism was quite a scourge in those cold, northern climates where winters left 
little opportunity for entertainment, cures were very much appreciated by suffering families.  
<p>
I looked forward very much to meeting Duncan, and one summer afternoon in 
Vancouver I had the opportunity.  I was visiting with Al and Rita, and was advised that 
Duncan would soon be arriving for a visit.  
<p>
We were aware when his car entered the parking lot of the apartment house, and we 
opened the door of Hubbard's fourth floor apartment.  We could hear Duncan tromping up the 
stairs.  As he turned around the last landing, I got my first glimpse of him. 
<p>
Duncan was a short, stocky man, with short arms.  Wearing a sleeveless sportshirt 
appropriate for the warm, sunny day, he was flamboyantly climbing the stairs, swinging his 
arms in a way that revealed the engaging movement of his exposed elbows.  A happy, fun-
loving grin lighted up his face.  Grasped in one hand was a large, green peyote button, which 
he stuffed into his mouth from time to time and chewed happily.
<p>
Duncan had also heard of me, and after being introduced, the first thing he did was to 
offer me a bite of his button.  I accepted, and found much to my surprise that it didn't taste 
nearly as bad as I had been led to believe.    
<p>
That evening we went out to dine at Hubbard's favorite place reserved for the most 
prominent visitors, the Vancouver Yacht Club.  It was a decorous setting, and an ideal place to 
get acquainted while simultaneously enjoying an excellently served gourmet meal.  
<p>
I was thoroughly engaged by the wonderful stories Duncan was sharing.  I had had such 
a small amount of the peyote that I never felt it.  So imagine my surprise when I looked at the 
lush carpet and found all the designs raised in three-D, and with glowing colors!  I was 
delighted, as this was the first time in my life I have observed visual effects without any 
feeling of ingesting a drug.  I felt only the well-being of superb companionship.
<p>
Duncan was telling us where he got the peyote.  At that time it was possible to procure it 
from a source in Texas.  He and his friends had chipped in and ordered a gunny-sack full.  
Not sure how it would be accepted by Canadian law, they elected to store it under the front 
porch of the home of one member of the group.  Here they felt it would be safe; this person's 
father was the local sheriff.  They never bothered to tell him about it.  
<p>
Duncan played an active role in Saskatchewan as a therapist and guide in the 
experimental use of LSD with alcoholic subjects.  Working with other hospital staff, 
encouraging results were achieved.  Duncan wrote a most knowledgeable handbook about the 
informed use of LSD in a therapeutic setting.  Despite it being written before 1960, it is still 
the most comprehensive, thorough, and knowledgeable treatment of the subject in print today, 
other than Stan Grof's volume <i>LSD Psychotherapy</i>(1). The work accomplished in the last three 
decades by other therapists (who have had to work underground because of our repressive drug 
laws) confirms the accuracy of the information presented. 
<p>
At one point there was a debate as to whether or not LSD is addicting.  Duncan was sure 
that it was not, so in order to prove it, he and his supervising psychiatrist took it every day as 
they sat with experimental subjects.  At the end of 30 days he declared that there was no 
change in his ordinary functioning. 
<p>
However, some of the authorities at the treatment hospital declared that he was addicted 
because he was taking it every day.  So they demanded that he and his supervisor stop taking 
it.  They stopped, and exhibited no adverse effects.  Duncan was a bit sad at being deprived of 
the opportunity to partake.  
<p>
I had the good fortune to share a few experiences with Duncan, and found him extremely 
sensitive, aware, helpful, and companionable.  He was one of the easiest persons to love I 
have ever met.  I grew very fond of him.  I regret the distance that separates us, and the 
exigencies in life that have widened the separation.  I often wonder what has happened to him, 
and what he is doing now.  I believe he retired to a home in Mexico.  If he has his way, I am 
sure that he is sharing a peyote button or two with some new-found friend. 
<p>
<center>
<i>Jeffrey</i>
</center>
<p>
Jeffrey was a long time friend, and one of the most interesting people that I have known.  
He was a teacher of religion and philosophy at one of our well-known universities, and always 
had a deep interest in the mystical and the occult.  For years he had meetings in his home, 
inviting outstanding personages to address or demonstrate to a group of friends who shared his 
interests.  
<p>
Jeffrey was thrilled to learn that there were substances available which could provide 
entry to the states with which he was so enamored.  He became one of the first volunteers, and 
thoroughly enjoyed his experiences. 
<p>
Besides his teaching occupation, Jeffrey was also a trained architect, and had designed 
and built a very beautiful home.  There is one additional area that I considered him a complete 
standout. 
<p>
One of the ways that Al Hubbard had taught us to prepare people for the psychedelic 
experience was to give them some inhalations of Maduna's mixture of carbon dioxide and 
oxygen(2). I personally had derived a great deal from this procedure.  It was a marvelous 
abreactor, and for me always released an enormous charge of repressed anger.  Despite the 
fact that the release was always freeing and exhilarating, I always approached the experience 
with a great deal of anxiety.  While most people who went through our program at the 
Foundation derived considerable benefit, it was such a drastic and dramatic procedure that no 
one underwent it eagerly.
<p>
Jeffrey was quite an exception.  He loved it.  He would take an enormous number of 
breathes -- up to 50, whereas most would release their inhibitions with 15 to 20.  But his 
experiences were always exalted.  He would have intense and varied imagery, often of 
outstanding architectural forms.  He always returned to normal consciousness with a bit of 
sadness at leaving such a wonderful world, yet very grateful for the opportunity to spend some 
time there. 
<p>
As we got busy with our work at the Foundation, I lost track of Jeffrey.  He developed 
some heart difficulties, and had bypass surgery.  Sometime after the closing of the Foundation, 
he came to visit a colleague and me in our business office.  He looked terrible, despite being 
his old, cheerful self.  He had lost an enormous amount of weight, and his face was blue with 
lack of oxygen.  He admitted that he was on his last legs, and wondered if there was any way 
that we could provide him with an experience before his departure.  It had been a number of 
years since he had had one, and he wished to reacquaint himself with the levels he hoped to 
enter. 
<p>
We promised to give it some thought.  After he left my colleague said to me, "Certainly 
we have to honor his request.  We now have MDMA, and it is such a remarkable material, 
what a wonderful way for us all to pay our last respects." 
<p>
I could feel fear grip me.  "Yes, but MDMA is a pretty powerful stimulant.  The major 
contraindication is with heart patients.  We could end up with a body on our hands." 
<p>
"So what?" said my friend.  "He's just about dead anyway.  He could die at any time.  If 
he dies, no one would be surprised.  What a marvelous gift for him.  I'll be glad to take 
responsibility for him." 
<p>
I agreed it would be a marvelous gift, and deeply admired my friend for facing the 
situation and being willing to carry it out.  I inhaled deeply, and pulled myself into the space 
of agreement and willingness to see the project through. 
<p>
Several of us were present and joined Jeffrey in taking MDMA at the 120 m.g. level.  I 
thought Jeffrey looked tense and worried.  However, as the effects came on he went outside 
and became absorbed in studying plants and flowers.  His concerns dropped away.  
<p>
We took a 40 m.g. supplement at the 1-1/2 hour point.  As we relaxed indoors, all the 
lines disappeared from Jeffrey's face, and he became very young and very alive.  The earlier 
pallor completely left him.  Jeffrey radiated warmth, and began to speak eloquently of the 
wonder, goodness, and beauty that pervades the universe, and the enormous gratitude he felt to 
the Supreme Maker of it all.  He pointed out how everything created had its appropriate place, 
and how wonderful it was to peacefully flow with the Life Force in all of its seasons.  His 
talking lifted us all into appreciation of these levels of awareness.  My colleague later joined 
me in the evaluation that this was our most spiritually realized experience yet with MDMA. 
<p>
Jeffrey was rejuvenated by this experience.  His color came back and he was filled with 
enthusiasm.  For several months he had been inactive.  Now he resumed some former 
projects, including working with elderly people.  He continued this activity for another six 
months before he once again became infirm.  We discussed another experience, but he knew 
his time was up and that he might not endure it.  He was very grateful for the additional six 
months of active life that the MDMA had given him.  Even more so, he was content with the 
perspective he had gained on his life, and was ready to move on. 
<p>
<center>
<i>Jules</i>
</center>
<p>
In the course of a lifetime one meets a great variety of people.  It is the outstanding ones 
that capture our attention.  Jules is certainly one of those.  Dynamic, full of life, bursting with 
humor, a skilled therapist, he was deeply committed spiritually.  This commitment was the 
central core of his life.     
<p>
Jules was even more outstanding in death.  At the age of 33, he contracted cancer and 
fought a successful battle to complete remission.  This experience gave him the understanding 
to be of profound help to others suffering from cancer, and aid them in conquering this enemy.   
<p>
Thirteen years later Jules underwent bypass surgery.  He lay in intensive care hovering 
between life and death.  At times he seemed on the path to recovery, only to have this 
followed by a relapse.  Sinking low, expecting the worst, he rallied again and again to extend 
his battle.  This continued for seven painful months.  At last, after a final surgery, internal 
bleeding brought him to the end.  But not before he awoke sufficiently to cheerfully say 
goodbye to his family and close friends. 
<p>
Jean and I recently attended a memorial service for Jules in his back yard. Over fifty 
people gathered there to give testimonials and pay their last respects. We had never witnessed 
such an outpouring of love and appreciation.  It included the intimate sharing of family 
members, statements from close, dear friends who deeply appreciated Jules in his various 
personality roles, descriptions of the support Jules had given to neighbors in difficulty, and 
most impressively, reports of clients who felt their lives were given to them by Jules's ability 
to help them climb out of deep holes into the daylight. 
<p>
All of Jules's close friends had rooted for him and prayed fervently as he lay helpless in 
intensive care.  During this excruciating vigil, we all had a chance to confront death and what 
was happening with Jules.
<p>
At first we understood his eagerness to cure his illnesses and come back to life.  But as 
he wasted away physically to the point where it seemed there were few resources to bring 
back, and as medical bills mounted astronomically, we wondered in different ways.  What was 
causing the recurring relapses after each indication of gain?  Practically all of us believed in 
reincarnation, and knew the faith Jules had in the survival of bodily death.  Was he afraid to 
go on?  Each in our own way pondered death and its meaning. 
The full impact of Jule's message for me personally hit me in a morning meditation.  
There are many approaches to spiritual development.  One broad class involves total surrender 
to God, being completely in the moment, and going with the flow of life.  Another approach, 
perhaps best exemplified by Michael Murphy in his book <i>The Future of the Body</i>(3), involves 
recognizing our unlimited potential and doing what we can to realize it.  Jules firmly believes 
in this latter approach, as do I.  It involves applying ourselves as best we can to develop the 
skills, perception, wisdom, and love to function at ever higher levels.  
<p>
This latter method provides the ability, I believe, to generate ever more power, to be an 
ever-increasing force in the world.  Yet it is a dangerous path, as the ego loves power.  The 
challenge is to keep an appropriate balance.  
<p>
The solution for me lies in the concept of partnership with God.  It is this partnership 
which we each must individually resolve.  If we rely completely on God to carry out our 
functions, nothing tangible will happen.  On the other hand, if we try to do it all ourselves, we 
become warped, distorted, cut off from others, and do not have the vital energy or perception 
for appropriate actions.  By being in tune with God, the power of the universe is with us.  I 
can give a great deal of personal testimony as to the futility and drain in personal vitality that 
comes from thinking I can do it alone.  
<p>
Jules was on the brink of developing immense power.  For seven months he lay as a 
true warrior, facing incredible pain and anguish as he rallied his personal resources to heal his 
body.  But in the end, it was not enough.  
<p>
Watching Jules, I clearly see the importance of being totally open to all sources of help.  
Yes, it is my responsibility to set the direction.  But only by surrendering to the situation, 
being completely open to all the forms of help available in the universe -- the strength of 
friends, the love and compassion of the wise sages that have preceded us, to that remarkable 
healing energy that comes through the Grace of God -- can powerful obstacles be overcome.  I 
felt it a true warning to me to be careful of my striving, to avoid attacking barriers by brute 
force and severely taxing my personal resources.  I must remain open and relaxed, be 
available to all the resources that exist, and allow them to nurture and support me.  In this way 
I can truly achieve my potential. 
<p>
Thank you, Jules, for your brave example, for your true spirit, and for the inspiration 
you brought to us all. 
<p>
<center>
<i>Edgar</i>
</center>
<p>
Spending a few days with our good friend Edgar has given me much to think about 
concerning the use of the sacraments.  
<p>
Edgar and his wife Grace are among our oldest friends.  We first became acquainted in 
the Sequoia Seminar, which initiated our spiritual search.  They were among the first to go 
through our program at the Foundation, and were enthusiastic supporters of our work.  They 
both felt that they had received a great deal of benefit from their experiences, and had opened 
up to many new possibilities in life.  They found much personal understanding, a new sense of 
peace and fulfillment, had considerably improved their marriage relationship and 
communication with their children, and had opened up appreciably to spiritual development.  
This last they considered to be the most important of all.     
<p>
Because of their character and experience, they were often chosen as "sitters" to take 
people home and be with them after they had undergone a psychedelic experience at our 
Foundation.  When it became apparent that persons who had gone through the Foundation 
program could benefit from meeting and discussing their experiences with others, Edgar and 
Grace formed and led a group for this purpose.  
<p>
They have both been willing subjects in our exploration of new compounds.  They have 
continued to reap benefits, and have often told us how much they are indebted to us for 
making these experiences possible. 
<p>
Edgar is a remarkable human being.  He is a large man, powerful and strong, yet under 
the right circumstances he is like a warm puppy-dog.  Edgar has amazing endurance, 
perseverance, and exceptional energy.  He drives himself hard, and his body shows the signs 
of strain.  Once he has adopted a goal, he latches on like a fierce bulldog, and cannot be 
deterred from proceeding full-bore until it is completed. 
<p>
He loves to be in control.  Edgar has remarkable confidence in his own ability, which is 
quite considerable, and can sometimes be quite stubborn.  He is blessed with a saintly wife.  
Grace has been extremely supportive, and has grown considerably as she has handled difficult 
situations. 
<p>
Edgar is extremely talented.  He is very bright, and an outstanding inventor with good 
management ability.  For years he was intrigued with the process of creativity.  Working 
jointly with a good friend also interested in the creative process and in the mechanisms of the 
human mind, they came up with some practical, working rules to foster the creative process.  
<p>
Edgar was fortunate to accumulate some capital through successful investments.  At age 
fifty-five, he had enough capital to retire.  But he was restless, and eager to place his 
knowledge of creativity to work in a successful business.  He found MDMA to be an excellent 
tool to enhance his creativity. 
<p>
But here we see manifested one of the real dangers of psychedelics.  Unless used with 
wisdom and the kind of objectivity that comes from a good peer group, their use can 
powerfully reinforce one's strongly held views.  In the case of his first independent endeavor, 
Edgar's single-minded approach, great confidence in his superior intelligence, and 
unwillingness to listen to advice from others led to substantial financial losses.  
<p>
Humbled and wiser, he set out on a new project with equal determination but a great 
deal more care.  This project was a very insightful one, and in addition involved genuine 
service to the market he envisioned.  It was a herculean task; it involved gathering an 
enormous amount of essential information that would be of use to designers everywhere.  The 
success of the work would depend on how completely all of the basic information was 
covered, how interestingly it could be presented, and how quickly specific information could 
be found. 
<p>
When the time came to approach publishers, he found immediate response.  Edgar ended 
up with a very favorable contract, and at the time of our last visit with him, had only four 
months more work to complete the project and send it off to the publishers in camera-ready 
form.  
<p>
As we visit with our good friends, Edgar and his wife, we tacitly agree to spend a day in 
communion with the sacraments.  The choice is the one which Jean and I have found to be so 
effective, 2C-E. 
<p>
As we get into the experience Edgar becomes quite uncomfortable, and has heavy, 
disturbing feelings in his body.  I have several suggestions to offer as to how he can ease this 
discomfort.  This involves his willingness to let go and allow the inner feelings to surface.  
However, Edgar refuses any suggestions.  He is so heavily defended against these inner 
feelings that he denies that his discomfort has anything to do with any inappropriate behavior 
or attitudes.  When it becomes quite clear that he wishes no help and does not wish to deal 
with his feelings, we leave him to himself and pursue our own experiences.  
<p>
The next evening as we are reviewing our journey together, Edgar shares that he 
experienced that everything is perfectly fine just the way it is.  Yet in further discussion, he is 
quite aggressive and judgmental of others.  As I wonder out loud if he considers his position 
"perfectly fine," he asks if there is any problem between the two of us.  I reflect carefully and 
say, "No.  But I do feel very sad that you suffer so physically and don't want to find ways to 
ease your pain."  
<p>
This greatly irritates him, and he attacks me for thinking I can solve his problems.  I get 
defensive and complain of his lack of trust in me and the fact that I might have learned through 
the years some useful approaches for resolving difficulties.  
<p>
Not feeling any real heat, and realizing the investment Edgar has in his position, I said, 
"You win, Edgar," and we went to bed amiably.  But on waking up the next morning , I 
thought deeply about it. 
<p>
Is there any benefit from subjecting Edgar to a psychedelic experience when he is so 
completely resistant to making use of the opportunity?  After all, he is deeply engrossed in an 
extremely important and valuable project, is under great pressure, and needs every ounce of 
his resources to fulfill his contract with the publisher.  I provided him a day of discomfort and 
possibly introduced a whole new spectrum of concerns to preoccupy him, just when he most 
needed his resources to complete his work. 
<p>
Of course I wouldn't knowingly do this.  I certainly have some basis for considering 
that such an experience would be helpful to him.  
<p>
I would like to use this occasion of sharing an exploration with Edgar as a basis for 
presenting some of my hypotheses about the nature of these experiences.  These hypotheses are 
an intuitive integration resulting from participating in and observing a great many experiences. 
<p>
I must first say that to my knowledge, from discussing the chemical action of 
psychedelics in the body with some of the most informed people that I know, that despite 
much speculation, there is no agreed upon understanding of what is actually taking place in the 
body to achieve the remarkable results observed. 
<p>
When a person ingests a psychedelic, there is an enormously complex set of variables:  
the person's psyche, which includes his value-belief system, his life experience and 
conditioning; the state of his body; the environment he is in; his preparation for the 
experience; and the action of the chemical itself on these various factors.  
<p>
The most important action of the chemical is to dissolve the barrier between the 
conscious and unconscious mind.  This potentially provides access to all our forgotten 
memories, repressed feelings, hidden motives, drives, values, and habits as recognized by 
Freud.  In addition, the unconscious includes the various dynamics proposed by Carl G. Jung.  
These include the archetypes of human behavior in all of its forms, and the Collective 
Unconscious.  These are elaborated upon in Appendix IV, where I describe my view of the 
nature of the self and realizing our true nature. 
<p>
But I believe there is something else that is quite important.  This is the relationship 
between the psyche and the body.  Alexander Lowen, in his book 
<i>Bioenergetics</i>(4), sets forth 
this relationship between the psyche and the body, and the flow of energy.  He describes how 
psychological characteristics produce physical armor, and affect body structure and movement.  
Thus correlates of our psychological dynamics appear physically in our body.  
<p>
I am personally convinced that neurotic patterns have corresponding stresses and toxins 
embedded in our musculature, which result in the dynamics postulated by bioenergetics.  
<p>
This means that even when one becomes aware of one's psychological problems, the 
toxins and armor are still stored in the body.  Psychosomatic medicine takes a lot of this into 
account, indicating that disturbances like ulcers, heart disease, colitis, etc. have psychological 
foundations.  Even after psychological insight has been gained, these toxins are much harder to 
remove, and yield only with the continued application of effort to free oneself of one's 
psychological problems by changing one's behavior.  
<p>
One of the properties of a good psychedelic, which I believe is not well known, much 
less understood, is that <i>it can clear the body of toxins and armor that accompany the psychological dynamics</i>.
Muscle tensions and stresses are relieved, so that the bioenergy that 
Lowen discusses can flow more freely, with accompanying improvement in mental-body 
balance.  Consequently at the end of a good psychedelic session, one has a sense of bodily 
renewal and freedom (if it has been a hard-working session with a lot of repressed material 
released, it is not unusual to feel tired afterward.  Consequently it may take several days to 
feel the full effects of such rejuvenation).  Behavior is much easier to change when the body is 
free of this load.  
<p>
This opening will last for a while, but can be dissipated if one continues in one's old 
behavior patterns and thereby rebuilds the toxins and the armor.  Probably a great source of 
disappointment for a large number of people who ingested psychedelics in the 1960s is that 
because of the power of what they learned, they expected the experience to change them. 
Consequently they did not put in the effort required to change.  The resulting discomfort of 
returning old patterns of behavior was often countered by a subsequent experience.  While a 
certain amount of change inevitably takes place, the presence of continuing uncomfortable 
symptoms can lead to disillusionment, or new defense patterns to hide the disappointment.  
For the person who genuinely wishes to change, the window of opportunity following a good 
psychedelic experience is an advantageous time. 
<p>
So now back to Edgar.  For complete rejuvenation, the psychedelics, or as I prefer to 
call them, the sacraments, work best by ingesting them and being willing to focus one's 
complete attention on the experience that results.  By holding one's attention on feelings that 
surface, the feelings eventually resolve themselves, often with an enormous breakthrough of 
understanding and release of repressed energy.  It often helps to stay focused on the feelings 
by consciously breathing through them. 
<p>
But suppose that one doesn't want to examine the feelings?  They can be quite 
uncomfortable.  Or the resulting insights can so oppose dearly held beliefs and actions that 
discovering the true nature of one's uncomfortable feelings would be terribly painful.  In such 
cases one might well want to avoid them completely.
<p>
As long as the individual is reasonably honest and cooperative, there is still some benefit 
just from the release of the toxic material and the armor.  Tensions can be relieved and new 
energy sources can be tapped, at least temporarily.  And it is always possible that with the 
passage of time, a person may review what has happened and be more willing to allow feelings 
to surface at a comfortable pace.  For it has been my experience (and more so lately as I have 
become more observant) that crusts are dissolved from the defensive walls that have locked 
down repressed material.  This, along with any new learning that may have taken place during 
the journey, can permit such material to come to the surface more freely in the days following 
such an experience.

So it is possible that there can be gains for a participant even though he or she is not 
particularly willing to deal with unconscious material that is loosened during the psychedelic 
experience.  And of course beyond what we consciously observe, there is a significant amount 
that transpires at various levels of the psyche that can lead to improved functioning with or 
without our conscious cooperation.

With these reflections on our experience with Edgar, I did not feel that I had done him a 
disservice.  Fortunately, this was confirmed about a week later in a phone call when he 
reported that he had gotten considerable rejuvenation and renewed inspiration from our time 
together.

<li>Another explanation of the bodily rejuvenation that comes from a good psychedelic 
experience can be drawn from the practice of meditation.  Psychedelics can so increase the 
intensity of the inner light at the core of our being that this light dissipates the toxins.  Often in 
a good meditation session, stiffness, soreness, tiredness, and arthritic symptoms are relieved.
