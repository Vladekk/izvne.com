Chapter 9<br>
Family
</b>
</center>
<p>
One of the great joys that Jean and I have experienced is sharing MDMA with our 
family.  We found special pleasure in drawing closer in love and understanding to our 
relatives.  First we introduced our daughter Dede (Jean's daughter, whom I adopted after we 
married), and then other family members.  Several proved to be gifted travelers.  Details of 
some of our experiences together follow: 
<p>
<i>Dede.</i> I first met Dede when she was ten years old.  I was accompanying some friends 
to visit Dede's mother for the first time.  Dede met us on the outside steps in the court of their 
apartment house.  Slim, extremely cute and personable, I hoped she looked a lot like her 
mother.  
<p>
After Jean and I were married, Dede and I had our problems.  Jean had previously 
focused her entire attention on Dede, and provided her with everything within reason.  Dede 
very much resented my intrusion into this very nice setup, which diverted Jean's attention to 
me.  For several years we had an armed truce.  Each morning I would come down the hall, 
and Dede would step out of her room with a sullen look on her face.  I greeted her as cheerily 
as I could, but most of the time got a barely audible response. 
<p>
One of the greatest moments of my life was several years later, when Dede was moving 
to her own apartment and Jean and I were preparing to move to the high desert.  I was in her 
room with her, a flamboyantly decorated room alive with color and new age posters.  This was 
her private space where she was free to express herself in any way she wished.  Many of her 
secret longings, as well as her artistic talent, were splashed on the walls. 
<p>
We were discussing our impending separation.  Dede said to me, "Dad, I want you to 
know that all these last few years when you've been telling me things, I pretended not to 
listen.  But I heard every word and I knew you were right, and they have helped me a lot." 
<p>
I was quite shaken by this announcement, and overcome with tears.  I have a hard time 
not crying as I write this. 
<p>
Jean and I shared MDMA with Dede the day after her 19th birthday.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
As soon as the experience develops to full intensity, Dede becomes aware of the way 
she is treating her body.  She finds that she is drinking too much alcohol and not getting 
enough sleep.  This is impressed upon her time and again.  
<p>
We have excellent communication among the three of us, with the marvelous freedom 
from defensiveness so characteristic of this substance.  We end the day with excellent bonding.  
</div>
Her second trial was a year later, in the company of other close relatives.  We are in a 
condominium overlooking the ocean at San Clemente.  
<p>
Dede has been suffering for some time from stomach problems, which her doctor has 
diagnosed as spastic colon.  She is under a lot of tension from a number of changes taking 
place in her life.  Her boyfriend is moving to San Diego to go to school, and she will soon be 
leaving her apartment for a new one.
<div class="inset">
In thirty-five minutes we are all well into the experience and enjoying it immensely.  
The ocean is a wonderful stabilizer and source of inspiration.  Everyone's voice, face, skin 
soften.  All of Dede's stomach pains disappear.  She feels free of pain and tension for the first 
time in months.  She watches the breakers, seeing them as long smiles, and the ocean saying, 
"Come play with me!"  She writes some poetry.  We are all having an outstanding time. 
<p>
After the supplement, Dede says that she has never felt better in her whole life.  She is 
very grateful for the experience.  One person suggests looking down on our bodies, and if we 
notice any tension or pain, heal it.  It works!
<p>
I find the ocean and heavy surf a great stimulus to exalted thoughts -- the timelessness, 
feeling of eternity, the marvelous state of the world, the hope for mankind, the wonder of 
these materials and those that make them possible.  There is a superb feeling of centeredness.  
</div>
<p>
It is an enormous grace to have our family drawn close together in such a satisfying, 
euphoric experience.  It turned out to be Dede's last experience for several years.  She found 
that leaving us after being so closely bonded was quite painful, and didn't care to go through 
the distress of separation again. 
<p>
<i>Manuel and Selma.</i>
One couple in our family is especially interesting.  My relative 
Manuel is an extremely open, good-natured, life-affirming person.  Over the years he has 
followed my work with great interest, and had several very rewarding LSD experiences with 
Al Hubbard.  
<p>
Selma is German-born, and moved to the United States after marrying an American 
officer, whom she later divorced.  She is very attractive, very bright and sensitive, and
fun-loving.  She and Manuel have an ideal marriage, in that they are very much in love and 
thoroughly support each other.  Selma has at times a sharp manner of expressing herself, 
which has been a bit difficult for some of the rest of us to accommodate.  However, we have 
all grown by accepting her and by developing the inner strength to not let her criticisms, real 
or inferred, bother us.  
<p>
Selma is quite a perfectionist.  She is also very accomplished, so that whatever she tries 
turns out well.  She was an excellent artist, and made a living by making rapid, cute, 
inexpensive paintings.  She gave this up when she married Manuel.  She is a gourmet cook, 
and her home is outstandingly decorated.  She and Manuel travel a great deal, and they have 
filled their home with beautiful art objects.  Unfortunately Selma puts herself under a great 
deal of tension, so that she has suffered from chronic pains in the abdomen for many years. 
<p>
Eight years before the arrival of MDMA in our life, we thought an experience with LSD 
might relieve her stomach pains.  Unfortunately, we did not handle the experience well.  We 
drove to Death Valley, which in those days was a favorite way to savor the sacraments.  We 
learned much later that many people do not relish being cooped up in a car for hours under 
these circumstances.  Also, there were several people in our party, so that Selma felt under 
pressure to perform.  We did not pick up her discomfort, so did not give her adequate 
attention.  Selma found her pain heightened, not only during the experience but for several 
weeks afterward as well.  Her lack of further interest was quite understandable.
<p>
So we were rather surprised when ten years later Selma became interested in our 
descriptions of MDMA, and wished to participate. 
<p>
Our first journey with Manuel and Selma was at Christmas at our home in the high 
desert.  A younger couple to whom we are related also joined us.
<p>
<div class="inset">
Selma has a rather difficult entry, feeling a lot of resistance, inability to concentrate and 
slight nausea.  She feels somewhat better as the experience develops.  She is a good sport and 
takes the supplement despite her discomfort.  We all move into a warm, close space and feel 
more and more alive.  Except for Selma, we are enjoying the experience enormously and are 
very grateful to be together.  Selma's state improves, which deepens the sharing and the 
bonding.  The next day she has opened up a lot, and tells us a great deal about the hardships of 
her life in Germany during World War II.  It was always a scramble to get food, and the 
Russian soldiers were aggressive, primitive peasants.  She was in some very difficult situations 
with them when they took over Berlin, and she survived by her guts and her wits.  
</div>
<p>
It was over a year before this same group came together for a second trial.  It was 
heartening that it came at Selma's request, despite the fact that she had previously experienced 
a lot of resistance which manifested as dizziness, feelings of faintness, and unpleasantness.  
<p>
What was fascinating to me was that none of these previous symptoms showed up in 
Selma's second experience.  Despite it being a year later, she took off from where she had left 
off previously, and moved into a very enjoyable and fruitful experience.  This dynamic has 
shown up a number of times in subsequent experiences with people.  More than with any other 
substance I have observed, it seems as though they start from where they left off before.  The 
amount of elapsed time between experiences does not seem to be a major factor.  This is a 
characteristic that very much warrants specific investigation.  The report of our second 
experience follows:
<p>
<div class="inset">
This turned out to be a most rewarding day for all of us.  We were able to perceive the 
best qualities in each other, and as we verbalized our views, our self-esteem, acceptance, and 
level of love and bonding rose to enormous proportions.  We were able to turn our attention to 
very specific family problems which under ordinary circumstances would be very difficult to 
discuss.  But here, engrossed in love and with no trace of defensiveness, we could share our 
perceptions freely, insightfully, and without rancor, leading to much heightened understanding 
and closeness.  But best of all, the inner good feelings kept growing and growing, until we 
were filled with enormous gratitude to be with each other and feel the love that we all shared.  
What a magnificent contribution to our family!
</div>
<p>
<i>Judith.</i>
One of the most remarkable people in my life is my beloved aunt Judith.  From 
when my brother and I were small kids, we loved to bask in her radiance.  She is a very 
bright, delightfully outgoing person, with sharp, penetrating perception.  She sees with crystal 
clarity what is right and what is wrong, and has very little tolerance for those who sluff off.  
And she is an oustandingly giving person.  At the slightest hint that someone she knows may 
be suffering from some discomfort, she is immediately there with hot chicken soup, blintzes, 
or a batch of cookies.  Being an outstanding cook, any goodies she shows up with are always 
welcome.  
<p>
When my mother died in 1956, Judith and her husband, Nathan, moved to Roswell, 
New Mexico, to live with my Dad.  A few years later Nathan died of Parkinson's disease, his 
last years made much more pleasant by Judith's scrupulous care.  She made an agreement to 
stay with my father and look after him until he passed away. 
<p>
Any person would be extremely lucky to have Judith look after them.  She is thoughtful, 
compassionate, understanding, and absolutely tireless and unselfish in ministering to the needs 
of others.  My Dad certainly had it good.  He had excellent meals just as he liked them, warm 
companionship, and could bask in Judith's delightful presence. 
<p>
It wasn't always easy.  Dad was demanding and unappreciative, like a lot of us, and 
could be quite cruel in his negligence of Judith and her needs.  And as for we brothers!  We 
were delighted that someone so capable was taking care of Dad, so that it didn't disrupt our 
busy lives.  This went over with Judith like a lead balloon! 
<p>
But she didn't suffer in silence.  She spoke her mind to us time and again, and we began 
to wake up and lift some of the burden of looking after Dad's welfare.  But it was not enough 
and too late.  After Dad died, it took a while for Judith to overcome the bitterness.  But she is 
a very forgiving person, so that in time she dropped her resentments and we could all be 
friends.  
<p>
While Judith was looking after Dad, I kept them abreast of my work in psychedelic 
research.  Judith had her hands full, and paid little attention.  After Dad's death, she moved to 
Tucson to be near her two sons and their families, and to do what she could for their welfare.  
She always had had a great deal of respect for me, so now she became much more interested 
in my work.  After a few years she felt that she had done all that she could to help her family, 
and was satisfied with their well-being and self-sufficiency.  So she could take the chance of 
having her mind altered, even if it was irreversible. 
<p>
She had heard quite a bit about MDMA, and this seemed the ideal substance to introduce 
her to this new world.  After Dad died she had become quite close to Manuel and Selma and 
to us.  We agreed to share a journey together.  So this is how a 79 year old woman undertook 
her first experience with MDMA. 
<p>
It was a beautiful setting, in a smartly appointed home.  We and our hosts, Manuel and 
Selma, were already very close from sharing our love with each other.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
We all take 120 m.g. of MDMA.  It comes on delightfully gentle and euphoric.  We are 
all in a most enjoyable space, thoroughly appreciating each other.  As it reaches full intensity, 
it opens a floodgate of communication for Judith.  Living alone, and not having intimate 
friends in Tucson, and not being too well understood by her family, she had withheld an 
enormous amount of thoughts and feelings.  Now it all comes gushing out.
<p>
She is so intoxicated she slightly slurs her speech, but continues almost non-stop.  As I 
observe her, she is like a powerful, bright, radiant light.  There is a marvelous, luminous 
quality to her being; it is a joy to be in her presence.  Her mind is sharp and clear; she allows 
absolutely no wishy-washiness to obscure her vision, no matter what the cost to herself.  
<p>
She has been very hurt by the misunderstandings that have developed within her family 
in Tucson.  Judith observes everything in an extremely clear light, and immediately expresses 
what she observes.  She does not see that for people without this clarity of vision, her remarks 
can be very scathing.  She recounts at great length the faults with various individuals and their 
unthinking, often unintelligent actions.  And how much she has been hurt by their reactions, 
which have included disbelief, opposition, rejection.  Having a very strong disposition herself, 
she doesn't understand how much people are hurt when their delicate egos are threatened, and 
how powerful are their defenses.
<p>
It is a great relief to Judith to be carefully listened to, and she unburdens a great deal of 
her resentments.  Then through our general discussion, she begins to appreciate that others 
may have a different viewpoint, to which they are entitled.  And she begins to see that real 
love and concern requires honoring others, and being careful not to confront them with 
information they are not really seeking.  Fortunately our own group, with our deep love for 
Judith, is a marvelous example of how caring people communicate.  She is a very sensitive 
person, and deeply feels the love from us all.  As we talk and explore different aspects of 
relationships, and as the experience develops, we continue to draw closer and closer.  It 
reaches the point where she experiences love far greater than at any time previously.
</div>
<p>
Judith is an extremely honest person.  More than anyone I have seen, she was 
determined to take the lessons she had learned and apply them directly in her life.  She lost no 
time in talking to her sons, her daughters-in-law, and her grandchildren.  There was still a lot 
to work out for real understanding, and of course it is difficult with a one-sided approach.  But 
her understanding of the dynamics between her and her family grew rapidly, as well as her 
self-confidence and contentment with herself.  She felt her MDMA experience was an 
enormous grace, and completely changed her life.  No one I have known has worked with 
more determination to bring her life into accord with the teachings of her experience. 
<p>
Judith has had MDMA two additional times.  Each time she has honestly examined her 
situation and has seen more clearly.  She has come to realize that some situations cannot be 
resolved, and not everyone wishes to take her advice.  She has learned to offer it when it is 
wanted.  But she has come to peace with her own situation, and no longer allows others to 
dictate her well-being.  Everyone in our family who knows of her experiences greatly admires 
her courage and her honesty, and her desire to be the best possible person that she can be.  
And every one of us consider it a great honor when we can spend time with her. 
<p>

. . . . . . .

<p>
Repeated experiences with family members continued to heighten our bonding and the 
joy of being with each other.  This has brought us full appreciation for what a family can mean 
to each other. 
<p>
While this same bonding and appreciation grows from sharing with good friends, I am 
drawn to feel that a primitive, basic requirement is fulfilled in pulling family members 
together.  It is as though learning to be close and acknowledging and supporting each other 
starts with the family.  It may be my Jewish heritage and the emphasis that Jewish people put 
on family.  And often it is hardest to develop intimacy with those to whom we are closest.  
What is certain is that the results of this approach are very satisfying.
