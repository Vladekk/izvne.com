The search for a relationship with the universal reality about us is one of the most 
important goals in human life.  It has to be conducted by two entirely distinct processes which, 
while concurrent, are totally different.  The passage through your lifetime of eighty to a 
hundred years (give or take a few decades) involves learning relationships -- giving and taking 
-- with those who share your journey on this planet.  And, at the same time, you play a role at 
this moment of human history.  Living your own personal life in the immediate present, you 
are also, to an often unknowable extent, a contributor to the structure of the world about you.
Myron Stolaroff has given us an autobiography, a tale of psychological and spiritual 
evolution that subtly brings together these two threads, these two roles; he is both the 
struggling seeker for wholeness in himself, and a discoverer of new paths to wholeness for 
others.
<p>
The story of <i>Thanatos to Eros</i> takes us through two marriages, over the course of the 
author's growth from a successful engineer to an independent business man, and eventually, 
we see his first steps and subsequent strides as a researcher and explorer of human 
consciousness.  We move with him through the often intense and difficult changes that take 
place as he learns to use his chosen tools, the psychedelic drugs, beginning with LSD in 1956, 
and progressing to other powerful visionary plants and drugs over the subsequent years.  He is 
trying to, in the words of Carl Jung, "make the unconscious conscious," as the way to attain 
realization of his ultimate self.  We discover, along with him, that this is a hard goal to attain, 
and that it must be sought with complete inner integrity and fearless self-examination.
<p>
Spun into the narrative are reports of some extraordinary experiences, brought about by 
the use of appropriate psychedelic drugs.  As Stolaroff learns himself, he gains in 
understanding of others who are suffering pain and self-rejection, and begins to guide friends 
who come to him in trouble, through carefully controlled and monitored psychedelic sessions.  
Needless to say, since the imposition of draconian laws in recent years, this kind of deep 
spiritual work, done with the aid of psychedelic materials, is no longer possible, and will 
remain forbidden until the public is better informed and directs its lawmakers to change such 
restrictions on these kinds of drugs.  
<p>
<i>Thanatos to Eros</i>, in the meantime, will serve the general reader and would-be 
researcher by defining the guidelines for the proper and safe use of psychedelic drugs in 
therapy and in spiritual growth.  It gives us not only many beautifully presented glimpses of 
psychedelic experiences as they are undergone by family members and friends, but also allows 
us to follow the further development of many of these people in the months and years 
following their life-changing sessions.
<p>
Psychedelic experiences are not uniformly positive, as serious researchers know only too 
well.  The psyche has its own agenda, and it includes exposure to places in the soul where 
sorrow and hopelessness reign supreme, where death stares implacably into the inner eyes, and 
only immense courage will bring the person through the dark tunnel and return him to light 
and livingness.  Myron Stolaroff describes several of these difficult sessions, helping us 
understand that they can be of immense value in someone's spiritual progress, especially if 
they are shared with a guide who "knows the territory" and can help in the emotional working 
through of the fear and sadness that have come to the surface.
<p>
But the true treasure of this writing is the subtle message it offers the reader as to the 
process of becoming a man of wisdom.  All cultures through human history have respected the 
teacher, the shaman, the priest, and the curandero who has been available to his community, 
his extended family.  Every society has its elders, its mavens, the wise, experienced and 
intuitive men and women who can offer answers to problems, counsel to the troubled, and 
medicine to the sick.  They have lived long enough to have achieved certain levels of 
comprehension, to have seen connections between cause and effect, to have perceived the 
changes wrought by time.  They have a form of knowing called wisdom.
<p>
However, it's a simple fact that the wise man, in his heart, doesn't know that he is a 
wise man; he is aware only of what he does not understand, cannot do, and does not yet know.  
<p>
He will often acknowledge having come to be more and more at peace with his immediate 
world, and perhaps having caught a glimpse of another world, an extended reality.  His 
answers to anxious questions have become increasingly direct and to the point.  He no longer 
wastes time -- his own or others' -- as he used to in the past, and his life is increasingly 
involved with a continuing process of integrating information, both consciously and 
subconsciously.
<p>
In Myron Stolaroff, we have a gentle, giving person who has become a helper, and 
guide and rescuer to many about him, but who does not see himself as an elder of the tribe, a 
shaman, a wise man.  This is the metaphor which is the second message of this remarkable 
book.  Enjoy the day to day narratives, and the drug experiences (mostly joyful, some 
difficult) that contribute to the developing relationships between participants.  But also follow 
the gradual evolution of an imaginative and intelligent person into a wise man who begins 
coming to peace with himself.  It is a beautiful story.
<p>
This process of personal growth and understanding could just as well have involved 
Buddhist practices of meditation, or training in shamanic plant medicines, or any one of 
innumerable other methods of achieving wholeness.  It so happens that for this good man 
psychedelic drugs have been the vehicle, and it is clear that they have served him well.
It was said by Lao Tse some 25 centuries ago:  "Understanding others is wisdom.  
Understanding yourself is enlightenment."  This book is a unique illustration of what was 
meant by that great sage, and will enrich the inner world of the reader.
