Appendix IV</br>
The Nature of the Self
</b>
</center>
<p>
My large number of experiences ingesting psychedelic substances has shed a great deal 
of light on the nature of the psyche and the nature of the human mind.  The raw data can be 
interpreted in a variety of ways, depending upon the viewpoint of the observer.  Information 
learned under the influence of a psychedelic is somewhat suspect, as it has been demonstrated 
time and again that perceptions are highly colored by the values, beliefs, and experience of the 
observer.  Such pre-dispositions can even be reinforced by the action of the drug.  An 
additional consideration is that the intensity of focus and clarity permitted by the action of the 
chemical highly emphasizes the significance of the point of focus in relation to other data.
<p>
However, with honest searching and the willingness to investigate a variety of 
viewpoints, a procedure can be developed for validating experiences.  It will no doubt 
incorporate many aspects of the advice for contemplatives in the Catholic Church.
Revelations are to be regarded with suspicion until verified by practical, proven methods.  
This includes tests of logic, appropriateness, and the assumption that if a revelation is true, it 
will repeat itself.  The contributions of an informed peer group are invaluable. 
<p>
Based on a large number of my own experiences and those of others, I have arrived at 
the following view regarding the nature of the human psyche.  The largest area to be 
explained, and what is least familiar to Westerners, is the nature of the human unconscious 
mind. 
<p>
I am convinced through my own observations that the most important action of a 
psychedelic chemical is to dissolve the barrier between the conscious and unconscious mind.  
This potentially provides access to all our forgotten memories, repressed feelings, hidden 
motives, drives, values, and habits as recognized by Sigmund Freud.  
<p>
In addition, a great deal of other information has been revealed which supports the view 
that the famous Swiss psychiatrist Carl G. Jung has been the most accurate assessor of the 
human psyche.  Many have discovered the worlds of symbols that Jung postulated as well as 
the various human archetypes that he described. 
<p>
Probably the most important concept of Jung's that has been verified is that of the 
Collective Unconscious.  This concept states that if each of us as individuals goes deeply 
enough into our own unconscious, we reach a vast, infinite sea that is common to all of us, 
and consequently joins us all.  This explains why such extra-sensory phenomena as telepathy 
and clairvoyance are possible.  It also is the basis of the harmony and oneness that is so often 
described in psychedelic experiences.  
<p>
The Collective Unconscious is infinite and includes every possible aspect of mind.  This 
accounts for the enormous variety of symbols, imagery, memories ancient and recent, and 
visits to other lands, times, and events that are so frequently reported in psychedelic journeys.  
The concept of the Collective Unconscious is a counterpart of Universal Mind, which is a tenet 
of many esoteric traditions.  As such, it contains all wisdom and all experience.  
<p>
Some esoteric traditions hold that there is such a thing as the Akashic Records (see 
Chapter 4, Note 2).  Here every action, feeling, and thought of every living creature is 
recorded, and is available to each individual through his own unconscious.  That would 
logically make it part of the Collective Unconscious. 
<p>
Within the Collective Unconscious is the Source of all being, which includes the origin 
of natural laws and all material objects and living forms.  This Source is also the genesis of the 
prolific imagery encountered in dreams, trance states, and psychedelic journeys, and is the root 
of wisdom, intuition, and creativity.  My experience of the Source is that it is at the core or 
essence of everything created.  This core is the life force, the radiant energy that suffuses and 
sustains all living creatures and all of creation.  I have sometimes perceived this as the Central 
Furnace.  
<p>
To approach this core is to approach the center of energy, an unbelievably brilliant light 
that is Love Manifest.  It is so bright and unimaginably beautiful that it is almost impossible 
to gaze upon.  Mystics have claimed that it is a light brighter than a thousand suns.  Meister 
Eckhart has stated that all the privations humanly bearable would amount to naught for the 
privilege of looking into this Face(2). We can learn that the Source of this love cares for each 
and every one of us, and everything in creation beyond anything we can imagine. And we as 
humans have the possibility of uniting with this core, becoming the source of this unbridled 
light and love and unending wisdom. 
<p>
This state has been given various names.  In Western religions -- Judaism and 
Christianity -- it is called Union with God.  The Buddhists, who have probably explored the 
nature of mind more extensively than any people on earth, call it realizing one's Buddha 
Nature.  In such a state we are immersed in the ground of being, the ground of reality, the 
ground of the mind.  Alternate Eastern terms for such a state are enlightenment or liberation.  
When we become truly enlightened or liberated, then we merge with our true inner nature or 
Buddha nature.  Liberation comprises freedom from concepts and conditioning, so that we may 
freely attend any aspect of Universal Mind or Buddha nature.  Excellent descriptions aimed at 
shedding light on the subjective experience of such a realization are given by Sogyal Rimpoche 
in his powerful book The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.
<p>
We are told by the great teachers, particularly Buddha himself, the Enlightened One, that 
enlightenment is a state that is potentially within us all, and can be achieved in this lifetime.  It 
is the birthright of every human being.  The twentieth century Indian mystic Ramana Maharshi 
claims that the only reason we are not enlightened is that we do not know that we are already 
enlightened.  
<p>
If such a magnificent state exists, and if the inner light is so profoundly intense, then 
why don't we experience it?  We are obviously shielded from this light by powerful, impacted 
layers of screens that we do not understand.  This is the residue in our unconscious mind.   
In examining myself, I find that my inner core is surrounded by layer upon layer of 
conditioning.  This conditioning is formed by repressed feelings, false ideas and beliefs, needs, 
stresses, drives, desires, and habits.  Much of this material blocks the expression of the true 
life force, which is love.  The more traumatic and painful were early life experiences, the 
more impacted and heavily defended are these layers of conditioning.  The solidity of the 
deepest layers of conditioning, and the difficulty of working through them, are discussed in the 
latter part of Chapter 2, pages 35 and 36.
<p>
A very important part of these occluding layers is that powerful, hidden part of 
ourselves that Jung calls our Shadow -- all of the information that we have a vested interest in 
hiding from ourselves.  Unfortunately, our Shadow controls a great deal of our energy and 
causes us to behave in ways of which we are not aware.  The greatest problem is that we 
project our Shadows onto others, and thereby make other persons the cause of our difficulties.  
Reconciling the contents of our Shadow, and taking full responsibility for ourselves, would 
accomplish an enormous amount in removing human differences and achieving world 
harmony.    
<p>
There are a variety of practices that have been developed throughout the world to discard 
this blocking conditioning and release our true, inner self.  In America, the most recognized 
way of seeking help to become free of the accumulations which make life unpleasant or 
unsatisfactory is to consult a professional therapist.  A good therapist can help us understand 
inappropriate unconscious patterns and help us get free of them.  It is often a very long and 
sometimes agonizing process. 
<p>
In the East a great variety of meditation practices have been developed to accomplish the 
goal of enlightenment or liberation.  These practices are quite time-consuming, and this can be 
a long, arduous path.  But once the benefits begin to be tasted, it is difficult to turn away from 
this course. 
<p>
The same things can be accomplished by the informed use of psychedelics, with some 
powerful additional advantages.  An outstanding characteristic of psychedelics when properly 
used is that they dissolve the boundary between the conscious and unconscious mind, thereby 
giving us direct access to unconscious material.  This can reveal much that is helpful for rapid 
personal growth.  
<p>
Another prime advantage is that under favorable circumstances, psychedelics can let us 
discover our inner core, thereby opening us to grace.  Grace can come in the form of wisdom, 
insight, and understanding.  Its powerful light of love is healing and rejuvenating.  The 
knowledge and certainty it can bring gives confidence, direction, and purpose to our lives.  
Grace brings energy and inspiration.  Once the door is opened to grace, it can be a continuing 
source of guidance and nourishment.

"If someone were to possess a whole kingdom, or all the goods of the earth, and were to give 
it all up for the sake of God and were to become one of the poorest people who live anywhere 
on earth, and if God were then to give them as much suffering as he has ever given anyone, 
for all his days; if then God were to allow him to glimpse his nature as it exists in this power, 
his joy would be so great that he would feel that all this suffering and all this poverty had been 
too little."
