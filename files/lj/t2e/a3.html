Appendix III<br>
Procedure
</b>
</center>
<p>
Experiments were conducted in a relaxed, informal setting as described by Shulgin, 
Shulgin, and Jacobs(1).  They were often conducted over a weekend.  This gave the opportunity 
for those participating to get together the evening before, get acquainted if necessary, and 
learn about the substance to be tried and its characteristics.  It also gave the opportunity to 
share concerns and aspirations, as well as determine individual dose levels from the data 
available.  
<p>
Participants chosen for research with new compounds (with the exception of MDMA) 
had previous experience with psychedelics, were stable personalities with whom it was easy to 
establish good rapport, and were unlikely to be frightened or overwhelmed by the surfacing of 
unconscious material.  They were assessed to have a favorable "set," a requirement for a 
fruitful psychedelic experience.  The following description of the effect of set and setting on 
the experience is excerpted from my paper in the journal 
<i>Gnosis</i>:
<div class="inset">
<p>
Set and setting have been widely recognized as the two most important 
factors in undertaking a psychedelic experience.  Of these set has the greatest 
influence. 
<p>
As the drug opens the door to the unconscious, huge spectrums of 
possibilities present themselves.  Just how one steers through this vast maze 
depends mostly upon set.  Set includes the contents of the personal unconscious, 
which essentially is the record of all one's life experiences.  It includes the walls 
of conditioning which determine the freedom with which one can move through 
various vistas.  Another important aspect of set consists of one's values, 
attitudes, and aspirations.  These will influence the direction of attention and 
determine how one deals with the material encountered.  
<p>
In fact one can learn a great deal by accepting and reconciling oneself 
with uncomfortable material.  Resisting this discomfort, on the other hand, can 
greatly intensify the level of pain, leading to disturbing, unsatisfactory 
experiences, or even psychotic attempts to escape.  This latter dynamic is 
largely responsible for the medical profession's view of these materials as 
psychotomi metic.  Surrender, acceptance, gratitude, and appreciation can result 
in continual opening, expansion, and fulfillment.
<p>
Setting, or the environment in which the experience takes place, can also 
greatly influence the experience, since subjects are often very suggestible under 
psychedelics.  Inspiring ritual, a beautiful natural setting, stimulating art work, 
and interesting objects to examine can focus one's attention on rewarding areas.  
Most important of all is an experienced, compassionate guide who is very 
familiar with the process.  His mere presence establishes a stable energy field 
that helps the subject remain centered.  The guide can be very helpful should the 
subject get stuck in uncomfortable places, and can ask intelligent questions that 
will help resolve difficulties, as well as suggesting fruitful directions of 
exploration that the subject might have otherwise overlooked.  The user will 
also find that simply sharing what is happening with an understanding listener 
will produce greater clarity and comfort.  Finally, a good companion knows that 
the best guide is one's own inner being, which should not be interfered with 
unless help is genuinely needed and sought. 
</div>
<p>
On the day of the session, the drug was taken on an empty stomach.  Participants were 
free to follow their own inclinations.  They could gather in groups and chat, or wander into 
private rooms or around the grounds for private exploration.  
<p>
The surrounding countryside provided beautiful vistas, looking over granite rock 
formations, a green meadow, and towering mountains.  There were many interesting spots to 
sit and drink in nature.  "The flat rock" was a favorite of mine I often referred to in reports of 
experiences.  It was a very large, flat-surfaced rock that sat above the surrounding landscape, 
and was surrounded by growing bushes and shrubs.  It looked over a green meadow filled with 
grazing cattle, and offered views of interesting granite rock piles and abruptly rising high 
mountains.  The view was commanding and revealed much of the beauty, mystery, and 
wonder of the high desert.  
<p>
Another favorite I called my "meditation rock."  It was a well-formed seat permitting 
reclining, atop an isolated, tall rock pile.  It had the advantage of a 360 , unrestricted view of 
the surrounding countryside.  It was an ideal spot for contemplating natural environments.
<p>
Except in special cases where individuals had specifically asked for help or guidance, 
each person was left to explore the experience in his or her own way.  Soft drinks and snacks 
were available.  Groups usually found it worthwhile to join together for mutual discussion 
after they had sufficient time for private investigation.  A good music system was also 
available, and many greatly enjoyed the increased enhancement often experienced with music.  
Music can be very inspiring in encouraging releasing to the experience and opening the door 
for new levels of exploration.  
<p>
The day following the experiences provided time for the participants to share and discuss 
their individual journeys.
