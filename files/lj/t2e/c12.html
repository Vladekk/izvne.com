<i>My Toughest Case</i>
</center>
<p>
Over one Labor Day weekend a number of years ago, my wife and I attended a three day 
conference at the Three Mountain Sanctuary. 
<p>
The Three Mountain Foundation was founded by Richard Moss, M.D., and follows his 
principles of teaching.  Richard Moss was once a practicing physician, but abandoned his 
practice when he discovered the value of the healing energies within us.  Since that time he has 
devoted his efforts to discovering and teaching others how to get in touch with these energies 
and make them manifest in their lives.  See Chapter 6, Note 5.
<p>
He has taught well, and we found this three day conference a powerful transformational 
experience.  The staff has worked out group exercises and programs them in such a way that 
the group energy and level of love keep building to a climax on the last morning.  I suspect 
that for many of the participants, they become aware of this level of energy for the first time 
in their lives.  
<p>
And the same may be said for the level of love in the group.  By the end of the 
conference, every member is practically in love with every other member of the group.  
Again, I doubt if they have ever experienced this level of love previously in their lives.  So 
profound are the feelings that one cannot help but sense that the entire activity is divinely 
guided, and all of the exercises, practices, and activities are for the purpose of releasing divine 
energy into the world.  
<p>
Out of the some twenty-five persons present, there was only one that I felt was a possible  
subject for our research, and with whom I cared to share the knowledge of our activities.  His 
name was Jackson.  
<p>
We broached the subject to him, and found him interested but frightened.  We left it 
open for him to arrange for a visit to us if and when he desired. 
<p>
We thought little more of it, so we were surprised a few days later when Jackson called 
and was rather desperate to come out.  He was quite shaken up by the fact that Peggy, his live-
in girlfriend of four years, had decided to abandon him.  The reason was that Jackson had 
never been able to make up his mind sufficiently to make a commitment to her.  She loved 
him and was a beautiful partner, but she had grown tired of his ambivalence and wanted out.  
<p>
Jackson was quite stressed, which I didn't feel was the ideal state to participate in our 
research.  After a few days he sounded better, and we agreed to see him. 
<p>
Jackson proved to be a fascinating individual, and working with him turned out to be an 
extremely instructive involvement.
<p>
I had been drawn to Jackson because he was quite bright, articulate, and seemed deeply 
committed to his personal growth.  I had overlooked many other factors, which began to 
become clear as we visited the day before our experiment.  I had not given due credit to his 
fear, or to his pickiness.  It turned out he had a variety of allergies, and was so fussy about his 
food that he had brought his own to the Three Mountain Conference.  In the pre-day getting-acquainted talks,
I began to see that he had constructed an amazingly effective system of self-defeat,
which would turn every incident and development against himself. 
<p>
Yet I had enormous faith in MDMA, having monitored a large number of experiences 
with no sign of any ill effect.  So with my knight-in-white-armor attitude, we set forth to help 
rescue Jackson from his various dilemmas.  What is that old adage about fools? 
<p>
On the following day, Jackson takes 120 m.g. of MDMA.  Jean takes 110 m.g., and I 
take 12 m.g. of 2C-T-2.  This has become my favorite substance for accompanying others on 
the MDMA journey.  It allows me to experience quite fully what the subject is going through, 
without the irritating effects that MDMA has on my prostate condition. 
<p>
The ascent is nice, the energy rising pleasantly.  We are in a good space in thirty 
minutes.  Jackson feels the energy and responds well.  We talk.  At one point I happen to 
mention to Jackson that he isn't listening to me as I speak.  This is the match that lights a 
bonfire.  It starts by Jackson immediately losing his poise, and descending into the darkness 
of his bitter self-criticism.  
<p>
He immediately embarks on the tale of his childhood woes.  He is an extremely 
sensitive, delicate creature, and he was subjected to awful indignities by both his parents.  He 
felt totally unloved, and manipulated purely for his parents' ends.  He was constantly given 
orders for behavior, and his mother even had him wear a leash.  His father was extremely authoritative,
insisting on having his own way even if it took physical abuse.  He hates both 
parents bitterly.  
<p>
His younger brother by four years was not exempt from his ire, since the brother re
ceived what little attention the parents had to offer.  Jackson is very much taken with getting as 
deeply as possible into his feelings, especially in the presence of two people devoted to careful 
listening.  He brings up much anger. 
<p>
At the hour-and-a-half point, Jean takes a 40 m.g. supplement of MDMA, Jackson 50 
m.g.  My dose of 2C-T-2 will last all day. 
<p>
Jean is well centered, enjoying the experience.  Jackson continues to get into his 
feelings.  He has the most carefully constructed mechanisms of self-destruction I have ever 
witnessed.  For example, he is starving for love.  Yet he detests anyone who gives him 
affection, for they must be stupid indeed to love a miserable soul like himself.  He refuses to 
do anything for anyone, because if they truly cared for him, they should do things for him 
with no expectation of return.  In fact, the thought of doing anything for anyone else makes 
him extremely hostile.  
<p>
What is there about a person which allows him to become so crippled?  Were his family 
really that awful?  Is he simply a remarkably sensitive person, crushed by the slightest fear of 
disapproval?  Is there some enormous karmic burden that dictates that he must use every 
opportunity to punish himself until his inner debt is paid?  These are great mysteries, but the 
bottom line is that Jackson isn't going to relinquish self-punishment without an enormous 
struggle.  
<p>
Jackson is a very bright person, did very well in school, and passed the CPA exam with 
flying colors.  But now he hates doing accountant work.  With these proven skills, could he be 
so afraid of personal failure that he is frightened of assuming any personal responsibility?  It 
is a remarkable dilemma, and promises an extremely busy day.
<p>
Jackson is determined to thoroughly examine his feelings, so Jean and I sit quietly by.  
At one point his rage is so enormous that I feel he can't properly discharge it except against 
some opposition.  So I agree to pin him to the floor, and let him take out his anger against me.  
He is a small, slight person, and I am much bigger.  Nevertheless, he has enormous strength, 
and becomes a mad, raving beast.  It takes all of my strength to keep him pinned down.  I am 
very glad that we have agreed to no violence, as occasionally when he slips out of my grip, he 
allows himself to be pinned down once more.  
<p>
He discharges enormous anger in this way, but there seems to be no end to it.  Yet he 
shows great courage and determination to get to the bottom of things.  But I do notice that his 
attention span is only a few seconds.
<p>
So when he asks for a second supplement (I had mentioned the day before that other 
materials might be available), I suggest it might be best if he devoted the remainder of the day 
relating what he has learned so far to his life situation and the world around him.  
<p>
But he claims that he is right on the verge of an important breakthrough.  Ah, the perfect 
hook for me!  How I would dearly love to seem him end the session with his feelings resolved, 
and ready to go back into life with new understanding and reserves!  I had conveniently 
forgotten a situation twenty years earlier which had demonstrated how disturbed clients elicit 
your cooperation by this ruse of being on the edge of a breakthrough.     
<p>
I agree a supplement might be useful; he immediately becomes frightened.  We go back 
and forth on this for a while until I become convinced that he really wants to use more 
chemical, and I think it would do some good.  So 5-1/2 hours into the session, he takes a 
supplement of 6 m.g. of 2C-T-2.  I take the same to lighten the load I am feeling.  
<p>
Jackson continues pretty much in the same vein, getting up much anger, at times 
appearing very beast-like.  I give him a chance to role play with his parents, I taking the part 
of first one and then the other.  This allows him to express more anger.  I tell him that one day 
I hope that he can do this directly with them. 
<p>
In the late afternoon we talk Jackson into taking a walk outside.  He is reluctant, but 
accepts our suggestion.  He finds it beautiful outside, and gets into some wonderful positive 
energy.  However, he is quite weak and occasionally sinks to his knees.  I feel it is his 
tendency to sink into inner experience.  He has almost no faculty for taking command and 
making decisions or carrying out actions to overrule his feelings.  He feels he is a bottomless, 
empty pit.  I suggest that he fill it himself.  He can concentrate on this only a short time. 
<p>
I hope he will discover how desperately afraid he is to find out how much he acutely 
desires love.  He shows little sign of this, so I begin to become more directive.  I wonder if he 
felt helpless with his parents, and he looks at this.  We discuss the importance of the rational 
mind, and the importance of being able to follow one's reason over emotions, the ability to act 
despite feeling fear, resentment, or other negative feelings.  During the walk, we practice the 
ability to drop the inner workings of the mind and pay attention to what is around us.  He 
succeeds somewhat and at times.       
<p>
I share how important it was for me to learn gratitude and appreciation.  He realizes that 
he never does.  He is able to see the surrounding drama of the countryside, and appreciate it 
for a while.  He acknowledges that it was good to go outside and experience the outdoors. 
<p>
We discuss forgiveness.  Back in the house, he goes inside himself and is able to forgive 
his mother, father and brother.  There is much pain and realization, particularly with his 
brother.  He recognizes his parents' limitations, and how he used his own unhappiness to 
create misery for his brother.  He is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel; he can 
experience some euphoria, good energy.  
<p>
Feeling that he is much stronger and insightful, I mention that I see him as very 
consuming in his relationships, that it is no wonder Peggy is leaving him.  He begins to get it.  
His initial response is to always feel hostile, as it is very difficult for him to take any advice or 
suggestion.  I suggest he has to grow out of this and look at the reality of the situation: what is 
really going on?  He needs to learn that everything is not an attack on him; he is the one who 
changes it to an attack.  He should look at things on their merit.  He requires complete 
retraining in this regard, as his patterns are so heavy and deeply set. 
<p>
He has made much, much progress.  I am on the sofa in the living room, and tell 
Jackson I am hungry, will he please bring me a bowl of soup.  He says, "Get it yourself!"    
<p>
I am flabbergasted.  I say, "Good God! I have stood by you all day, answered your 
every wish, and now you can't even bring me a bowl of soup?!!  I don't give a damn how you 
feel, I want some soup!!" 
<p>
He gets it, and finds out it feels good to do so. 
<p>
He wants to discuss his relationship with Peggy.  I role play with him.   He is still very 
torn.  Now he understands how awful he has been; he discusses going back and serving her.  
Yet he still feels some repulsion in being with her.  We discuss the possibilities -- his fear of 
intimacy, his unwillingness to care enough to have to do something for someone, his fear of 
discovering his own self-hatred.  We retire with this issue unresolved. 
<p>
Jackson spends a sleepless night, and the next morning he is still unresolved about 
Peggy.  He would like to go back and plead for her to stay with him; he will promise to 
change.  But in his heart he still can't make the commitment.  
<p>
I suggest he stay with us another day.  We take a hike and do some good talking to 
integrate our experience.  He comes to peace with the outdoors, and begins to feel much 
better. 
<p>
Jackson showed an enormous amount of courage and persistence in facing his inner 
demons.  The problem of now resolving them in his life will be the biggest task he has ever 
faced.  The next few days will be the hardest.  If he gets through them okay, I believe he will 
steadily gain strength. 
<p>
Jackson returned home still ambivalent over his course of action.  But this was settled by 
Peggy, who insisted on leaving.  This was a hard blow for Jackson.  Fortunately he had some 
friends and teachers whom he could rely on for support.  But he had an agonizing time coming 
to terms with his experience and the blow of separating from his partner.  He was in constant 
touch, and for a while was living on the edge.  He gradually pulled himself together, and in 
time was able to return to a productive profession.  He is now happily married and helping his 
new wife to raise her son.

<i>My Most Rewarding Case</i>
</center>
<p>
Ralph is a very competent industrialist from New York.  In his early sixties, he has 
accumulated substantial wealth through his creative designs and products produced by his 
company.  He was visiting the Three Mountain Foundation, and upon hearing my name, 
wished to visit.  He has had a long-standing interest in psychedelics, and has managed to share 
experiences with a number of the outstanding figures in this field. 
<p>
We found him to be a very positive, energetic person, who much preferred talking to 
listening.  He requested to participate in our research.  I did not encourage him, for although 
he has had many outstanding experiences, there was little evidence of his incorporating his 
insights into his lifestyle.  
<p>
But he was persistent and stayed in touch.  He furnished evidence of important changes 
taking place in his life, and I was feeling guilty over my judgmental attitude and unwillingness 
to help when asked.  So we set a date for an experiment.    
<p>
In briefing him the evening before, I told him that he needn't bother with the tape 
recorder he always used.  He continually carried with him tape recordings of previous 
sessions.  These were recordings of beautiful, highly inspirational wisdom of the most 
profound sort.  Many were the kind of aphorisms one might wish to supply to an aspiring 
seeker of enlightenment.  Ralph obviously got much pleasure in playing these for people, and 
it was clear that part of his feeling of superiority rested on the outstanding perceptions revealed 
in these utterances. 
<p>
Ralph was quite taken aback by my suggestion.  I asked him if he would not prefer this 
time to concentrate on incorporating such truths into his lifestyle rather than just listening to 
the recordings.  He agreed. 
<p>
The next morning, Ralph takes 20 m.g. of 2C-T-2.  Jean and I accompany him with 12 
m.g. each.  I stay light so that I do not get caught up in my own dynamics, and can be of 
maximum support.  
<p>
As the experience develops, Ralph gets quite uncomfortable.  He experiences a great 
deal of anger, which I encourage him to release.  Later I look at him and see enormous fear in 
his eyes.  I ask him if there is anything he is afraid of. 
<p>
He replies that he is afraid of going crazy.  I say, "All right.  Go ahead and go crazy.  
Assume this living room is a padded cell.  I will be the padding, and not let you do anything 
destructive, either to your self, anyone else, or anything in the room."  
<p>
These words flowed spontaneously from me, and I knew I didn't dare to stop and think 
about the possible implications.  Ralph is a good deal larger and heavier than me, and I might 
have my hands full.  Yet I felt a strong inner confidence, and had no hesitation in proceeding.  
<p>
Ralph begins to roar, emitting aggravating, bellowing sounds.  He is pouring enormous 
feeling into his roaring.  It takes a strong heart not to be frightened.  He begins to gasp, and it 
looks as though he might throw up.  Jean runs for a plastic bucket from our utility room and 
puts it in front of him.  I encourage him to throw up in the bucket.  He heaves and heaves, 
making deep, retching sounds, without expelling anything physical.  After a few minutes of 
this the sounds diminish.  Ralph seems spent and sits down to rest, looking out the window.  
<p>
Ralph reports that an amazing thing is happening.  As he looks out of the window, he 
hears his own heart beating.  Then he realizes that his heart is beating in synchronism with the 
central heart of the whole universe.  The whole universe is beating together!  
<p>
Then he realizes that he and the universe are one, and he begins to sob.  He is filled with 
joy, and the ecstatic feeling of being in harmony with all that is.  He feels totally freed from 
all previous discomfort; he has achieved that most precious realization of which man is cap
able, the state of Union with All There Is.  
<p>
Ralph is overjoyed.  In spite of having had many outstanding experiences in the past, he 
had never before experienced this level of realization.  He is filled with wonder and gratitude. 
<p>
Simply being present to share this experience is very gratifying.  There is a deep 
satisfaction in being open to inspiration, and knowing that things have worked out well. 
<p>
I do not know how well Ralph has retained this experience, or how it has affected his 
day-to-day life.  I do know, however, that it is an experience that cannot be forgotten.  I 
cannot help but believe that in some way, even without conscious encouragement, the effect of 
such a contact with the Numinous creeps into our values and our thinking and our action. 
<p>

<i>Death Valley</i>
</center>
<p>
There are places on the surface of the earth which people call "Power Points."  The 
locations are invested with special significance, and it is claimed that they make available to 
earnest seekers aspects of Reality not ordinarily perceived.  
<p>
I admit that there have been some special locations, like St. Paul's cathedral in Rome, 
and even some locations in nature, where I have sensed something special. These places have 
had an unusual impact on me.  But in general I am afraid I am rather impervious to these 
energy fields and perhaps the ideas behind them, as exemplified by the fact that I feel nothing 
particularly special about the claimed vortexes in Sedona, Arizona.  However, it is impossible 
to deny the impact of the outstanding beauty of the whole Sedona region.  
<p>
If there are such things as power places, then Death Valley National Monument in 
California must certainly be one of them.  And if it is, it must be because of the outstanding 
human events that have occurred there.  Some of the foremost occurrences of my life have 
taken place at Death Valley.  These have transpired while riding or driving through the valley 
under the influence of an outstanding sacrament.  For this purpose, I know of none better than 
Sandoz's LSD.  
<p>
If outstanding events, or powerful feelings, or being overcome with reverence, wonder, 
and beauty, can leave an aura like Sheldrake's description of morphogenetic fields, then 
Death Valley is surely a power spot.  I have had many such occurrences there, and I am in
clined to believe that our continued profound experiences do build up such fields, as being in 
the valley is conducive to furthering such experiences.  
<p>
This was driven home all too well in the following event.  Our friend Max was visiting 
us, and when other invited guests failed to show up, it seemed an ideal time to introduce Max 
to one of our favorite journeys.  It had been some while since Jean and I had conducted 
anyone on this tour.  Years ago we used do it rather frequently.  But we discovered that for a 
well-focused experience, it didn't make much difference where one was, and the comfort of 
our living room avoided many miles of driving.  Yet for the candidate who is ready to take 
advantage of such an experience, the Death Valley tour is very difficult to beat. 
<p>
And this was a very special occasion.  We are very close to Max and have excellent 
rapport.  And Max is a very eager and appreciative explorer.
<p>
We embarked on our journey, giving Max a full measure of what we deemed 
appropriate.  Jean took one-half this much, and I took half again, agreeing to do the driving.  I 
planned to take a like amount once reaching the valley floor, with the difficult part of the drive 
behind me.  
<p>
There is always the question of whether the amounts chosen are adequate, considering 
such things as the aging of the substance and the possible psychic resistance of the imbiber.  In 
twenty minutes I was feeling very little and beginning to get worried.  Then Jean broke 
through and reported that she was quite intoxicated.  Not too long after, Max was swept away, 
finding his dose as powerful as what he would ordinarily expect from three or four times the 
amount he ingested.
<p>
For myself, it was very slow coming on.  By focusing on stillness and holding my mind 
quiet, it accentuated the progress of the chemical.  I began to feel it more and more intently, 
and by the time we crossed the Panamint Valley, it was so intense that I wondered if I would 
supplement.  
<p>
As we drove up toward Towne pass, moving into the remarkably colored mountains of 
the Panamint Range, the beauty grew greater and greater in intensity.  There came into view 
an unusually sculpted, exposed section of mountain which my friends affectionately call 
"Myron's Grotto."  It never fails to move me to tears.  It is shaped like a huge grotto, with a 
pinkish-white, rough rock background.  Carved out of the wall are many tall figures, in dark 
pinks and reds and whites, standing looking out over the Panamint Valley.  To me they always 
appear as the guardians of Death Valley.  They stand at the entrance inviting us in, and 
assuring our safe and worthwhile journey.  They are the custodians of the higher regions, and 
as we pay them due respect, the treasures of the valley are revealed.  
<p>
Now verbal descriptions become totally inadequate.  Only the most artistic, articulate use 
of words can begin to convey the remarkable sights we behold.  The mountain cliffs are 
saturated with color, and the formation of the gorges and weathering patterns unfold an endless 
variety of stunning visuals, each more beautiful than the previous.  We are overwhelmed by 
the amazing variety of form, surface, and color.  Somehow some deep hunger inside of us is 
assuaged by this massive variety of input, flooding us with beauty.  
<p>
The beauty slackens as we reach the top of the pass, where we are surrounded by just 
ordinary grassy slopes.  But descending the other side, the massive vista of the valley comes to 
view.  Here is an amazingly broad expanse of flat surface, whitened by the remains of past 
floods of water. The water has long since evaporated, leaving behind the mineral deposits 
which mark its former presence.  On either side of the valley rise mountain ranges with 
tumbling, distorted layers of sedimentary rock, in many places tilted by underlying igneous 
intrusions.  The mountains are carved into a great number of narrow canyons, the result of 
endless eons of constant weathering. Everywhere is the same continuing variety of color, so 
that no matter where you look there is interest and beauty.  And in the heart of the expanse of 
the valley floor are bare, wind-swept dunes of the finest, pure sand.  
<p>
But the best is yet to come.  Approaching the sand dunes, I take my supplement.  Shortly 
after that we come to the area where the pupfish spawn.  In the heat of the summer, when 
every trace of water evaporates, these remarkable little fish bury themselves in the mud and 
hibernate through the summer and winter.  In the spring when water returns to the deepest 
sloughs, they come to life, bubble up, and swim into the water and spawn.  
<p>
Jean and I had once visited here with two good friends to observe this phenomena.  They 
were program writers for the company I then managed, Multi-Media Productions, Inc., a 
company that made sound filmstrips.  The emerging of the pupfish was photographically 
recorded for a program they were producing.  Viewing this area focused me on the company, 
and I sank into some miserable feelings.  This was a very poor outcome, I thought, of taking 
the supplement.
<p>
But I remembered the various devices I have learned to get away from uncomfortable 
feelings.  First I looked to see why memories of Multimedia made me uncomfortable.  I saw 
many good things that had transpired, particularly the contributions of other people, that I had 
failed to acknowledge.  I now did so, and this released my feelings.  It was like unresolved 
karma that needed redemption.  Now I could turn my attention to my surroundings.  
<p>
Once more I focused on the stillness, held my mind steady, and began to appreciate the 
beauty of the valley floor.  Like turning on a huge faucet, feelings of love and energy began to 
swell within me.  As long as I stayed focused, these feelings rose to enormous proportions. 
<p>
Now we turn south on the road that leads to the Artist's Drive.  This part of the drive is 
particularly spectacular.  The mountain range to the east descends until it extends into the 
valley in long, weathered mounds, almost like huge paws of giant animals kneeling, facing the 
valley.  These hills are solid, fine dirt, deposited by the run-off from the higher elevations.  
Again the colors are remarkable, being all shades of chocolate and brown, with some light 
cream colors occasionally thrown in.  The road is very close to the foot of these hills, and the 
intimacy makes them all the more spectacular.  
<p>
At last we turn into Artist's Drive.  We climb steadily to the very foot of the vertical 
cliffs overlooking the valley.  Whatever I said before about colors, shapes, and beauty, is 
completely swamped by what we now face.  It is absolutely indescribable.  The colors are 
brilliant -- fiery reds and pinks and greens and purples.  But the textures -- the textures are 
unbelievable.  Surfaces full of holes of all shapes, thin sculptured layers of rock that look like 
veils, contours and shapes and surfaces never before seen, all alive with ever-changing color.  
In our state of clarity everything stands out in the most minute, remarkable detail.  The beauty 
is overwhelming, and we are simply undone.  We cannot look at such beauty without crying 
and crying.  We are beside ourselves with joy and ecstasy.  It seems that nothing on earth can 
equal the sights we are beholding, or match the deep stirrings of our souls that are taking 
place.  We must summon enormous strength to be able to continue to watch it.  The car moves 
slowly on, constantly revealing new surfaces, new colors, new vistas.  It is almost more than 
one can take.  
<p>
We crawl along for several miles, looking at one breathtaking view after another.  And 
we are in the midst of it.  You can almost reach out and touch some of the phenomenal 
formations.  What magnificent artist assembled this astounding collection of visions?  How did 
all of this beauty come to reside in this particular place?  What greater evidence could one 
possibly wish for the astounding creator of our world?  And how could one possibly express 
sufficient gratitude for this amazing experience we are privileged to undergo?  Overwhelming, 
overwhelming, overwhelming.  
<p>
We finally reach the Artist's Palette, and stop to pull ourselves together.  We are still in 
the presence of an amazing variety of colors, and they are exhibited at this location in greater 
intensity and variation than anywhere else.  Behind the remarkable display which is near the 
viewing point stand the tall mountains with their variety of formations and splashes of various 
hues.  Beyond the Palette these huge cliffs provide an endless exhibition of wonders to be 
examined.
<p>
The drive continues through intimate hills and formations.  Some look, as Max suggests, 
like Italian ices, with the flow of different flavorings poured over the mounds.  Others have 
smooth, glassy, bubbly surfaces as though water were running down over them.  And around 
some turns the high mountains in the background become visible, alive with colored patterns 
that according to Jean look like the designs on multi-colored Indian skirts.  
<p>
At last we are at the end of Artist's Drive, and we return to the main road fully satiated.  
The sun is now getting low, and long shadows are creeping across the valley.  But the 
surrounding mountain ranges take on new appearances in the soft, warm light of the setting 
sun.  As we drive across the valley with the vistas spread before us, a new, soft glow 
overtakes them.  This is the glow of our inner being, fully content, basking in the love of our 
mutual warmth, reflecting on all that appears before our eyes.  
<p>
Throughout this astounding journey, I have numerous occasions to be grateful for 
various things I had learned in previous journeys.  I am blessed to have a sense of the 
Presence, which as I pay attention to it, comes more intimately into awareness.  I am grateful 
for my Tibetan Buddhist meditation training, which has helped me learn to hold my mind still, 
thereby offering the space for other dimensions of reality to present themselves.  I am grateful 
for the ability to look with love and appreciation without manipulation, as only in this way can 
the more profound levels of energy, meaning, and radiant love reveal themselves.  And as we 
depart the valley, once more passing the grotto, I become aware of the countless wise and 
enlightened ones who have gone before, and only wait to be asked to direct their love and 
support to enormously enhance our realization. 
<p>

<i>A Magic Journey</i>
</center>
<p>
I have described in the beginning of Chapter 10 the particular joy of journeying with 
special friends. 
<p>
Two of our good friends are a remarkable pair.  Edward is a kind, gentle, extremely 
sensitive soul who is practically a saint.  He is deeply committed to the Divine, and lets very 
little stand in the way of his devotion.  He is studious, well-read, and thoroughly grounded 
concerning the world's religions and spiritual literature.  
<p>
His companion, Larry, is a totally different personality.  He is a dear, gentle soul, -- 
young, handsome, and warmhearted, a lovable comrade.  Thoughtful, attentive, sensitive, he 
is always right there with support and assistance to anyone who may be experiencing 
discomfort.  His own mind is very fluid so that he easily moves through different states of 
experience.  
<p>
They live in a beautiful home in a wooded area at the foot of a commanding mountain.  
They have made their home an idyllic retreat for friends seeking respite from the tumult of 
modern civilization.  Truly imbued with the spirit they strive to manifest, with discerning taste 
they have created a beautiful, restful, inspiring environment.  Their garden is laid out 
tastefully with flowers in every nook, a beautifully designed mandala composed of brick laid 
in the soil, and plantings of trees and shrubs to provide a peaceful setting intimately in touch 
with nature.  Restful vistas look over rocks, colored earth, and towering mountains in the 
background.  The slightest breeze creates whispering among the branches in the surrounding 
trees.  
<p>
Inside are tastefully selected furnishings, skillfully placed to provide for comfortable 
listening to music or for interpersonal discussion.  Selected artifacts blend color and interest to 
provide archetypal connections to a higher state of awareness.
<p>
Best of all is the way each visitor is treated as a highly honored guest.  Almost every 
need and wish is anticipated and fulfilled.  Exquisite meals are provided with the same care 
and taste in preparation, so that each meal is gourmet.  
<p>
I know of nowhere where one can be better treated than at the hands of these two caring, 
solicitous individuals.  
<p>
Jean and I always look forward to a visit with our very good friends.  Taking their 
spiritual dictum seriously, they always see us as manifestations of the Divine, and treat us 
accordingly.  For persons like myself who are attempting to reach such a state of functioning, 
Edward and Larry are inspiring models.  It is a great privilege to be on the receiving end of 
such genuine attention.  
<p>
For our last visit they had a special treat in store for us.  We piled into their van, which 
had been well prepared with food and supplies for our journey, and we took off for Canyon de 
Chelly.  There Jean and I took a room in a comfortable motel.  There was still enough daylight 
to drive around the rim of the canyon and examine some outstanding views. 
<p>
I have seen many spectacular places on earth.  In the past I rated first the Artist's Drive 
at Death Valley, viewed in the afternoon sun.  Then came the Grand Canyon, and close on its 
heels the magnificent country surrounding Sedona.  But all of those fade in ranking beside the 
grandeur of Canyon de Chelly.  
<p>
The Canyon has a color close to the marvelous pinks of Sedona.  But the high, sheer, 
massive cliffs, the sculpted walls, and the isolated towers of vertical rock depict a stateliness 
and might transcending that of any of the places I have seen.
<p>
The canyon walls are striking in every direction.  Each turn reveals new faces, sculpting, 
and formations.  Below the massive walls is a flat river bottom, covered with trees and 
cultivated fields.  We are at the peak of fall, so that the trees are illuminated in brilliant fall 
colors -- yellows and golds and pinks.  It is pure magic to look over this inspiring landscape.
<p>
In the morning we hire a guide and walk down into the canyon.  It is thrilling to step 
over the weathered, colored rock.  At places we cannot see a path past the rapidly descending 
rocks, but our guide carefully picks the way.  In some unusually steep locations, footsteps had 
been carved into the rock to allow safe passage.
<p>
At the bottom of the canyon, we can appreciate the high canyon walls in all of their 
magnificence.  Simultaneously we walk past colorful cottonwood trees in their fall brilliance.  
The river bottom is dry, but the very fine sand and the numerous rocks strewn over the valley 
floor reveal their own display of the Supreme Artist's craft.  The canyon floor is cool, but 
pools of sunshine offer opportunities to bask and throw off the chill.  
<p>
As we walk, ever new faces, images, and massive sculptures come into view.  Most 
anywhere on the canyon floor we are content to simply sit down and look. We could spend 
hours in any one spot examining the various surfaces of the cliffs, the structures and 
weathering patterns, the figures that can be elicited from the rocks.  Overhead the sky is 
crystal blue, but with unusual wispy, curly clouds floating overhead that carry their own 
revelations of meaning.  On many of the high ledges are the famous cliff dwellings where 
civilizations once resided. 
<p>
Exposure to all this grandeur and beauty, in the presence of intimate friends, cannot help 
but unleash one's spirit to soaring heights.  With this barrage of light and beauty, do we dare 
to enhance the energy with a sacrament?  We do.
<p>
It isn't long before I begin to doubt the wisdom of this move.  We were in a remarkable, 
loving state, bombarded with beauty.  As I begin to feel my old initial discomfort on starting a 
sacramental journey, I wonder if I'm not being too greedy.  This feeling intensifies as I 
become more and more uncomfortable.  
<p>
A number of realizations come flooding in.  My body is getting more uncomfortable, yet 
we had told our guide about ruins we wished to reach that were several miles away.  I begin to 
think about the comfort of our living room, and how nice it is to be completely undisturbed 
and simply relax to the experience. 
<p>
Then there is our Indian guide.  A young man of around twenty-two, he is obviously 
moody and unhappy with life.  When we had gone to the Visitor's Center that morning to 
select a guide, he was the only one who had gotten up early enough to show up.  It was 
obvious that Edward relied a great deal on my judgment in making this important selection.  
At the time I saw nothing wrong with him, and approved his enterprise in being there early. 
<p>
He no doubt is very sensitive, and begins to pick up my uncomfortable feelings.  He is 
concerned with my age, and whether I can manage the steep descent, or for that matter the 
long walk.  The more uncomfortable I become, the more unhappy he looks. 
<p>
I find myself amazingly disturbed by the presence of our guide.  I feel his unhappiness 
and judgment to the extent that it is spoiling my experience.  Once more I deeply appreciate 
how in our work we have created a safe, comfortable environment, free of distractions, which 
allows the subject unrestrained experience.  As my discomfort continues to grow, I too long 
for a situation where I can simply let go and be free. 
<p>
My discomfort becomes excruciating.  I yearn to collapse on the ground and allow my 
feelings to flow out and dissipate.  I stop frequently to sit down and relax, and get some 
measure of release.  This very much disturbs our guide, who worries about my physical 
condition.  He obviously does not want the responsibility of over-taxing an elderly person.  He 
gets more and more impatient as he sees that we are not going to make our destination. 
<p>
Finally he says we must hurry, as he has an appointment to see a sick person in the 
hospital in the early afternoon. 
<p>
At first I am even more uncomfortable, feeling the time pressure.  Then I begin to wake 
up.  I begin to realize how much I am allowing the guide to dictate my experience.  Here we 
have driven hundreds of miles to take advantage of what Edward and Larry no doubt consider 
the greatest experience they can provide for anyone.  Instead of appreciating the outstanding 
beauty and all that they have done to make this journey possible, I am fretting over pleasing 
our guide!  I can feel Edward's deep disappointment in the miserable experience I am having, 
and in my concern with the attitude of our guide. 
<p>
Feeling more myself, I speak to the guide.  "When we hired you, you didn't mention 
any previous appointment.  We don't care about any particular place to get to.  We want to 
take our time.  We've come a great distance to see this canyon, and we may want to take all 
day to enjoy it." 
<p>
I speak in a firm tone of voice, and the guide immediately becomes contrite.  He says 
that we may take as much time as we wish -- all day if we like. 
<p>
I feel very relieved with this settled.  Both Edward and Larry are glad that I spoke up.  
>From this point on I am more relaxed and begin to free up from the disturbing feelings.  It is 
not long until the rewarding aspects of the experience begin to manifest, and I drop my 
uncomfortable feelings and turn my attention to the surrounding grandeur.  Yet somehow the 
guide has deeply affected me, and I am aware of his distracting impact throughout the day.     
<p>
Now a most marvelous transformation is taking place as the sacrament takes effect and 
all of my senses dramatically open up.  This results in what must certainly be as much impact 
of light, beauty, and meaning that the human frame can stand.  Each moment is absorbed in 
eternity.  The wonder of the Supreme Artist overwhelms the conditioned mind.  It is only by 
letting go of all preconceptions, values, dictates, that the mind can flow sufficiently free to 
begin to embrace the wonders being revealed. 
<p>
All senses become wide open.  It becomes apparent that everything in our surroundings 
can expand into new dimensions of detail, beauty, and clarity.  From the minutest blade of 
grass to the huge walls of the canyon, I can observe a striking array of detail.  The closer I 
look, the finer is the detail.  I must surrender and open myself to allow this enormous 
expansion of input into consciousness.  This results in a sublime feeling of release and 
exultation as I become increasingly in touch with new worlds of input.  
<p>
To apprehend the worlds of new data, my own being must expand to encompass them.  
My individual self and its notions of personality are rapidly transcended to encompass the 
grandeur of the myriad dimensions of creation.  What an exalted feeling!!  How in the world 
can one find words to describe such a bombardment of overwhelming, exultant beauty?!!  It is 
impossible to describe the privilege and the gratitude of being treated to such celestial glory.  
<p>
At one point Edward and I confront each other.  As we gaze at one another, I observe 
layer after layer of conditioning being stripped away until I am looking at the very radiant core 
of Edward's being!  Again, words fail to describe the incandescent resplendence of this 
remarkable sight.  We stop when we can no longer master the strength to hold steady before 
such splendor.
<p>
Later after climbing out of the canyon, we are back at our motel.  We are sitting 
together on a little patio, looking out over comforting trees and lawns and up at a sky filled 
with wondrous clouds.  The clouds are forming and reforming in magical patterns.  We are 
reviewing the events of the day.  As we sit and talk, the bonding among us deepens, and we 
feel utter contentment and gratitude.  
<p>
I am drawn to the clouds.  They always pull me out of myself and invite my 
participation; they promise rewarding excursions into new dimensions.  I know I must be 
perfectly still.  Fortunately I am able to do this.  As I hold still explosions of energy take 
place, and images fly by.  It settles down to stability, and in the stillness a new energy creeps 
into my being and fills it.  Again I realize that it is in the stillness that God can become 
manifest.  By being still, I provide an avenue for Him to enter the world and make His 
presence known.  His presence is a burning fire of love.  Holding still, I can allow this love to 
flow into the world and burn up the dross that encumbers mankind.  How this is done and to 
what extent I do not know.  I only know that this is the most wonderful and satisfying thing I 
can do, and brings me into exultation.  In some mysterious way I cannot understand, I am 
confident that it opens a door somewhere for others to touch an exalted state.  
<p>
This seems to me the best hope for the world.  Ignorance, self-interest, and destruction 
are preceding at such rapid paces around the globe, there is no certainty that our civilization 
can be rescued.  But if it can, it will most likely be by those who are willing to become 
channels for this Divine love and hold steady against the pain, suffering, and ignorance of 
mankind.  If enough join this enterprise, then I am convinced that sufficient light can be 
brought to bear to eventually help people wake up.  
<p>
I take a good look at Edward.  During the day I had become aware of how he holds off a 
certain amount of glory by not considering himself worthy of accepting the full impact.  As I 
look at him I see a beautiful, magnificent being, a true saint, totally committed to God's work.  
Over the ages he has brought truth and inspiration to those who are searching.  His kindness, 
gentleness, and wisdom mark an outstanding being, radiant with love.  I have no right to 
criticize or judge in any way this remarkable man.  I need only acknowledge his fullness and 
greatness and divine nature.  And as I think about it afterwards, this is the best I can do for 
any person. 
<p>
As I edit this writing a month later, the impact of the whole experience returns.  
Different surroundings, the energy fields of different persons, have a way of eroding the 
grandeur of this outstanding experience.  Now I am very grateful I have written up this 
experience, as just reading it over brings back the glory and privilege of this remarkable event.
