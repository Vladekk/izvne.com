MDMA
</b>
</center>
<p>
For those who have been privileged to enter the sacred regions and appreciate the vast 
array of learning at our disposal, the psychedelics are priceless substances.  But one stands out 
as especially unique, with outstanding characteristics exclusively its own.  This is MDMA, 
code name for 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine(1).
The most fitting description that I can give it is that it is an outstanding Grace.
<p>
David Nichols(2) has suggested a new class for this and similar acting substances, 
recommending the name entactogens -- substances which allow "touching within."  Ralph 
Metzner, in a paper "Psychedelics and Spirituality" delivered at a 1983 conference in Santa 
Barbara, has suggested the name empathogens -- substances which bring one closer to oneself 
and others.  
<p>
MDMA is not hallucinogenic like other psychedelics.  It is in most cases quite euphoric, 
bringing about a sense of peace, wholeness, and well-being to the participant.  It permits one 
to see the world in an exciting new way, alive with energy, color, and euphoria.  And 
remarkably, these responses are quite uniform over a wide range of participants.  
<p>
This characteristic of uniformity is quite different from other psychedelics, where an 
enormous range of responses is possible.  Results with the most active psychedelics depend on 
a variety of factors such as the subject's individual value system, the state of his/her psyche, 
the subject's aspirations, and the setting for the experience, including the character of the 
companions present.  While these factors are also important for MDMA, the action of the drug 
considerably overrides their influence, providing a much wider range of acceptance for 
suitable candidates.  
<p>
I will never forget my own introduction to MDMA.  I was still in the stage where every 
psychedelic experience started with several hours of discomfort, as I previously reported in 
Chapter 2.  This was the first time this did not happen to me.  Once the drug took effect, there 
was a marvelous energy rush, and I was in a state of euphoria!  Everything around me was 
delightfully infused with light and energy.  Never had I so enjoyed an experience.  Observing 
that I was well into the effects, my sponsor came over and said to me something that I shall 
never forget:  "Welcome to my world!"  And what a world it was.  A beautiful, loving, 
euphoric world free of the dead serious learning and striving I had always carried with me into 
these journeys.  A world alive with light, energy, meaning, and especially love. 
<p>
MDMA was a great discovery, and Jean and I immediately began to study it more 
extensively.  As we got more familiar with it, we began to define some of its characteristics. 
<p>
While MDMA did not lend itself to introspection as readily as some other substances, it 
did permit a great deal of clarity and self-understanding if one were motivated to turn his/her 
attention in this direction.  Problems were accurately perceived and their solutions apparent.  
There was a remarkable tendency when in this state to feel exceptionally whole and with no 
need to defend oneself.  Participants could readily discuss differences with others with 
remarkable freedom and insight.  
<p>
In a study that Charles Wells and I did on 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7, we compared the first 
time use of those substances to the initial use of MDMA.  We had this to say about MDMA in 
our paper(3):
<p>
<div class="inset">
MDMA has been widely used and reported upon.  The most complete treatments are 
Adamson (1985)(4), Eisner (1989)(5), and Beck et al. (1989)(6).
Eisner (1989) contains a complete, annotated bibliography of the scientific literature on MDMA
through 1988 (including a sampling of the popular literature) prepared by Dr. Alexander T. Shulgin.
In our trials, we most often administered an initial dose of 120 m.g. followed by a 40 m.g. supplement at the 
one and one-half hour point to sustain the experience.  This dose level seemed optimum with a 
surprisingly wide variety of subjects.  We found the major characteristics to be a satisfying 
feeling of being centered and whole, a feeling of euphoria, freedom from uncomfortable or 
untoward responses once the full effect of the drug was established, a sense of inner security 
with no need to defend oneself, and an ability to look at oneself honestly and with detachment.  
</div>
<p>
Our subjective observations of MDMA are reported in more detail in Chapter 14, Story 
of a Marriage. 
<p>
After a number of trials of MDMA with other people, it became apparent that this was 
the best substance with which to introduce people to psychoactive drugs.  With other 
substances, we had always used great care to make sure that the subject was ready for an 
experience that would greatly alter his perceptions, understanding, and perhaps his view of 
himself and his behavior.  MDMA is so generally euphoric and non-threatening that a much 
wider range of subjects can benefit from the experience without discomfort. 
<p>
We were privileged to have so useful a tool, and extended our study of it to a number of 
people.  One area of application that was particularly satisfying was with our family.  We were 
extremely gratified with the level of bonding that resulted from sharing MDMA with different 
family members.  Even my older brother, who was a particular nemesis of mine in my 
childhood, consented to share the experience.  While he never became an advocate, he enjoyed 
the experience.  Joining him permitted me to drop some ancient grievances for the bullying I 
had received as a younger brother, and allowed me to perceive him in a warm, new light.  
While advancing years alone can produce maturity that enhances closeness, this experience 
created a bond that shall always remain.  
<p>
While sharing the experience of MDMA with close family and friends was always 
satisfying, we began to become aware of a limitation.  The experience was most enjoyable and 
very centering.  Yet it did not open the doors to a wide range of exploration as effectively as 
other psychedelic substances.  
<p>
Another disadvantage was the large amount of chemical ingested.  This produced some 
toxic side-reactions, such as jaw-clenching and muscle tensions.  We found that continued use 
of MDMA gradually eliminated these side-effects, as though the causes were being dissolved 
away through additional experiences.(7)  Even so, the aftermath was not the same as with the 
established psychedelics such as LSD and mescaline, which most often leave the body quite 
cleansed and rejuvenated.  
<p>
MDMA is short acting, reaching a peak in one hour, and beginning to decline in another 
thirty minutes.  A supplement at this 1-1/2 hour point of approximately 1/3 of the original 
dose will keep the experience going at peak intensity for another hour or so (others have 
reported that a two hour wait to supplement is more satisfactory).  But once the effect wears 
off, the activity suddenly drops.  
<p>
If one's psyche is relatively clear, the descent is quite euphoric, and the remainder of the 
day is spent in a very satisfying state of contentment.
<p>
However, if there is unresolved material in the unconscious that did not get dealt with 
completely, the drop in the action of the drug seems quite sudden, and one is left physically 
uncomfortable and somewhat unsettled. 
<p>
To counteract this we thought, why not supplement with another, more powerful 
substance?  This turned out to be a splendid idea.  I particularly liked it, because what made 
the beginning of my psychedelic explorations uncomfortable was the negative karma
I had accumulated, which had to be expiated before I could thoroughly enjoy the experience.  Now I 
could dispose of this with MDMA, which occurred, I felt, automatically and very pleasantly.  
So when I took the additional substance, I was ready to soar into fresh spaces free of my usual 
psychic load.
<p>
This worked very effectively. In fact, everyone invariably reported that their experience 
with the psychedelic supplement was better than using that particular substance alone.  MDMA 
is an empowering launching pad.  
<p>
This worked so well that I embarked on a study to prove that 
every good psychedelic was better if first preceded by MDMA.
It didn't matter whether the psychedelic was ingested at 
the normal supplement time, one hour and thirty minutes after ingesting the MDMA, or an 
hour or so after taking the normal supplement of MDMA.  People often preferred the latter 
just to enjoy the MDMA state longer, and then go into the somewhat different experience 
provided by the second drug.  
<p>
Unfortunately, this investigation was never carried to a conclusion because of the 
temporary placing of MDMA in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in 1985.  
MDMA was permanently made a Schedule I substance in 1988.  It did give us time to find out 
that LSD, 2-CB, MEM, and 2C-T-2 were all enhanced when MDMA was taken first.  We felt 
that MDMA and MEM was a particularly powerful combination for one earnestly seeking 
solution of his/her problems.  More data on this last combination is reported in Chapter 5. 
<p>
The procedure of starting first with MDMA might not have as much benefit for 
experienced explorers. 
<p>
Because of the efficacy of combining MDMA with other substances, we focused our 
attention on these combinations for a period of time.  Except for one report covering the 
combination of MDMA and LSD, this work is reported in the chapters covering the second 
drug. 
<p>
At times when administering MDMA, Jean and/or I would choose a different substance 
to accompany the participants.  In my own case, I was suffering from prostatitis.  The extreme 
dehydration resulting from the ingestion of MDMA made urinating difficult even with copious 
amounts of water.  It also caused painful urinary irritation.  As this malady grew worse, 
painful urination would last as long as a week after an MDMA experience.  And with frequent 
experiences, it was well to avoid the discomfort of the greater toxic after-effects of MDMA.  
<p>
We found that a dose of 16 m.g. of 2C-B would allow us to enter the same space as 
those on MDMA and participate fully in their experience.  It was unnecessary to take a 
supplement, and the descent and after effects were much improved.  Still later, we found 
2C-T-2 even more satisfactory, and it would remain active for a longer period of time.  Doses 
of 8 m.g. to 12 m.g. are effective, depending on the psychic burden of the group (those 
weighted down with problems absorb more energy).
<p>
Undergoing a transurethral resection of the prostate completely eliminated the urinary 
problem with MDMA.  However, by this time I had learned to use 2C-B or 2C-T-2 to obtain 
all the benefits of MDMA.  These two drugs also permitted greater freedom in exploring 
other levels of thought and feeling.  So I abandoned MDMA except for special occasions. 
<p>
The scheduling of MDMA took place in 1985.  Although set aside by an appeal, it 
became permanently scheduled in 1988, and remains so to this time.  The legal ramifications 
leading to the scheduling of MDMA are covered by Bruce Eisner(5), pages 26 to 31. 
<p>
The references in the notes of this chapter describe a wide array of experiences with 
MDMA.  Below are a few excerpts from our own experience.  For the most part, these 
experiences were conducted unstructured, simply observing how different persons would react.  
Carefully preparing the subjects, focusing the experience through serious intention on the part 
of the participants, and repeating the experience to further the results would considerably 
enhance the outcome. 
<p>
<center>
<i>A Sudden Shift</i>
</center>
<p>
This report indicates how rapidly strong negative feelings can be dissipated.  Jean and I 
had tried MDMA only a few times when we moved to the high desert.  Our enthusiasm for 
this new substance was so great that we were eager to share it with close friends. 
<p>
Two weeks after our move, several friends were visiting us.  Jean was not at all well, 
being worn out from our move and trying to fit our multitude of belongings into a smaller 
house.  Her anxieties were compounded by having to play hostess before our house was 
properly settled.  She reported that she was anxious, very depressed, and exhausted. 
<p>
One astute visitor assessed her state, and suggested that we share MDMA.  All agreed. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean took 100 m.g., the rest of us 120 m.g.  It was a beautiful fall day, and we all 
opened delightfully to the experience.  Everyone's face became soft, young-looking, and took 
on a transcendental look.  Jean became deeply relaxed, and all of her troubles melted away.  
The supplement deepened the experience and increased the bonding among us.  We felt blessed 
to be together.  
<p>
The afterglow on the following day was outstanding.  We had all been quite moved by 
the experience, and were reluctant to part.  Jean had totally dropped the uncomfortable 
feelings of the previous morning.  For the next few days she cheerfully undertook the 
considerable task of getting our home in order.  
</div>
<p>
<center>
<i>Recovering Her Voice</i>
</center>
<p>
We are visiting a young friend, Adele, who is an excellent singer, accompanying herself 
on the guitar.  She has been quite run down, dropping in and out of the flu, and is very low in 
energy.  This has resulted in a very raspy throat and she is unable to sing.  She hopes an 
experience with MDMA will be helpful. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean takes 100 m.g. of MDMA, Adele and I take 120 m.g.  As the effect of the MDMA 
comes on, paintings on the wall come to life.  The wallpaper is a dark gold; I see it getting 
very bright and attractive.  I doubt if I shall ever see it dull again.   I am intensely 
intoxicated, probably the deepest so far.  Everyone's skin has softened; the two girls look 
radiant and beautiful.  We all feel glorious.
<p>
At the height of the experience, Adele decides to sing to us.  She plays and sings 
perfectly.  Her voice is angelic; there is no trace of the raspiness in her singing, or in her 
speaking voice.  She discovers that she has been pushing herself too hard, and needs to take 
more time to relax.
</div>
<p>
<center>
<i>Introspection</i>
</center>
<p>
Jean and I were introduced to MDMA in a group, and found group participation most 
rewarding.  We loved the interchange, the freedom of communication, the bonding with oth
ers, often heightened by focusing the discussion on significant issues in our lives.  
<p>
This was a welcome contrast to the directed, interior journey we employed in the Foun
dation days, and used by many other therapists.  While the interior journey is most valuable in 
getting acquainted with yourself in all of its aspects, group interchange has much to offer in 
developing social skills and an appreciation of others.
<p>
I often became aware that I was not really listening to others.  I learned a lot about how 
to truly listen, and how satisfying it is when others listen carefully to me.  I also became 
aware of my discomforts and how to be at ease with others, especially those who knew a good 
deal more than I did.  
<p>
This group participation was so very rewarding that it was difficult to consider using 
MDMA any other way.  But one time when Jean and I were sharing an experience, she felt 
introspective.  I used the silence to look around at the clouds and the mountains.  I found that 
the quiet leads to a far different kind of experience, much more like LSD.  I saw much 
imagery and great beauty in the clouds.  I experienced profound realizations of the power of 
love and how it flows from the Source as the greatest of all gifts.  And how our lives can be 
transformed in expressing it.  
<p>
On a different occasion, in taking a walk around the property under the influence of 
MDMA (something we usually don't feel like doing), the surroundings lighted up with 
signifcance and meaning, just as with the more powerful psychedelics.  It became clear that 
even though each substance has its own particular characteristics and tends to focus in 
particular areas, once one became proficient at utilizing that substance, it can with volition be 
directed in other useful ways.  
<p>
<center>
<i>A Young Couple</i>
</center>
<p>
Estelle is a classmate of my daughter at Occidental college.  She and a friend of hers, 
Graham, are visiting us in the high desert.  Both are quite spiritually oriented and practice 
meditation.  They had both used LSD in their earlier days with mixed results, and had 
abandoned it.  While they had discovered some of the higher levels of awareness they were 
seeking, they often got into uncomfortable spaces that made the experiences unrewarding.  
Now they are intrigued by our description of the new substance, MDMA, and wish to 
experience it.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
Estelle and Graham each take 100 m.g. of MDMA, Jean and I 120 m.g.  Graham feels a 
powerful surge of energy and is riding a wave.  The tension he usually feels with LSD is 
absent.  He begins to glow brightly; there is nothing negative or painful.  He reports a 
suspension of judgment and being more in the moment.  
<p>
Estelle experiences some resistance.  She finally breaks through, and is all smiles.  She 
had been afraid that I would try to control her experience, since I had been so ardent about the 
virtues of MDMA.  She is quite relieved to find that I let her have her own experience, and 
thanks me.  Graham reports that I had been a bit too strong for him also.  Now we all feel 
quite intoxicated, enjoying the beauty, the joy of being with each other, the superb feeling of 
love, and the ease of sharing with each other.  
<p>
Estelle and Graham go for a long walk, thoroughly enjoying being outdoors, 
experiencing nature and deepening their relationship.
<p>
Reviewing the experience, Estelle had not experienced much enhancement in vision or 
colors, but felt things more deeply.  She particularly liked the outdoors, feeling the wind and 
experiencing smells.  She felt that she worked through some barriers and very much enjoyed 
spending a day away from the intellect.  
<p>
Graham felt very open and that it was much safer to share.  He felt very energetic and 
ready to frolic.  He now has a greater appreciation of things and more primitive sensations.  
</div>
<p>
As a result of this experience together, Estelle and Graham discovered how much they 
cared for each other, and some months later they were married.  They now have two children 
and are pursuing successful careers.    
<p>
We didn't hear much from them, although we were present at their wedding.  About a 
year after, Graham confided in me.  He apologized for not having expressed appreciation for 
the day we spent together.  He wanted me to know that it was a turning point in their life and 
brought them together.  For this they were both extremely grateful.
<p>

<i>Face to Face With God</i>
</center>
<p>
Veronica is a beautiful young girl of 30 years, a close friend of my son and his wife.  
She is a very sensitive person, and has a talent for channeling other levels of awareness.  In 
the past she has been intimidated at the prospect of using psychedelics, but at last felt she was 
ready for an experience.  Because of her sensitiveness, she starts with a lighter dose of 100 
m.g. of MDMA: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
She had a remarkable breakthrough.  She was positive that she was going to die, so she 
decided to let herself die.  She melted into the ground, and then appeared before a profound, 
brilliant light, the throne of God.  She knew that she was with God, and that she 
 God.  
She was in ecstasy, and began to sing.  She turned into a delightful little girl, utterly alive, 
bright, full of joy and wisdom.  She was so beautiful, inside and out, that she was a joy to 
witness.  She felt her channel was wide open directly to the Source and was extremely 
insightful about whatever subject took our attention.  
<p>
We all take a 40 m.g. supplement of MDMA, and the experience continues in the same 
vein for the next two hours.  We all feel remarkably rejuvenated, and exult in the marvel of 
this experience.
</div>
<p>
About a year later we see Veronica again.  She has had a miscarriage at three months.  
<p>
She not only is suffering the loss of her child, but underwent some painful medical procedures.  
She is visiting to recuperate and would like another MDMA experience. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Veronica takes 100 m.g. of MDMA.  Jean and I monitor on 16 m.g. each of 2C-B.  As 
Veronica gets into the experience, she cries over the pain of her loss.  She has always feared 
the death of someone close.  But now things are changing.  She sees the loss as a gift.  Life 
and death are the same -- the problems are our attachments, what we think we want.  God is 
present in the deepest pain.  There is nothing but love.  Life is so beautiful, so vast.  We are 
never given more than we can handle.  Life is never cruel; we are forced to open up to look.  
God loves us so much.  
<p>
Veronica continues, life means so much more when we experience death, especially the 
death of the ego.  Veronica feels one with all women.  Heavy karma is now a blessing.  
Everything is more alive.  It is a blessing to be a woman.  This has been a most rewarding 
experience.
</div>
<p>
<center>
<i>Freeing the Body</i>
</center>
<p>
Veronica has made excellent use of her MDMA experiences, but does not choose to use 
psychedelics frequently.  Her next experience is seven months later.  Visiting us in our son's 
home, she suddenly realizes how much she yearns for another experience, as she is carrying an 
overwhelming load. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Veronica takes 110 m.g. of MDMA.  As she gets into it, she requests my assistance 
with Focusing.  This is a procedure developed by Eugene T. Gendlin; it is fully described in 
his book entitled <i>Focusing</i>(9). I have found this to be one of the most effective means I know to 
contact and release hidden feelings, and particularly to relieve the body of stress.
<p>
I lead her in the process, encouraging her to alternately feel without resisting the feeling 
she has chosen to examine and then find the most appropriate handle -- a word, phrase, or 
image that best describes the feeling -- as described in Gendlin's book.  The action of the 
MDMA accelerates this process, and she responds dramatically.  Her body expresses itself.  It 
feels tired, neglected, unlistened to, pushed around.  Veronica has not listened to her body for 
years.  She loves her body, but there is much control, which produces stress.  There are many 
people who depend on her; although she loves to nurture others, she has been overdoing it and 
has been neglecting her body.  Now it is unhappy and alone.  She finds that she doesn't 
forgive easily, but holds things close to her chest.  She particularly wants noted in the record, 
FORGIVENESS IS THE ANSWER TO SADNESS.  Now her body feels great because she 
has been listening to it.  
</div>
<p>
<center>
<i>A Very Special Day</i>
</center>
<p>
Sophia has been a good friend since the days of the Foundation.  She went through our 
program, and it made a very significant impact on her life.  She redirected her life into 
spiritual growth.  In the intervening years, she has made outstanding progress and has been a 
great source of inspiration for many whom she teaches.  Her husband Gregory also has deep 
spiritual interests and is an excellent scholar.  
<p>
Sophia had lately been pondering the advantage of another trial of the sacraments.  She 
was delighted to hear of the new substance, MDMA, and Jean and I agreed to travel to their 
home to join them in an exploration.   
<p>
I arrived the sickest I had been in over a year.  I had a miserable case of the flu -- 
dizziness, aching bones, extreme tiredness, deep chest cough, and congestion.  I wondered 
how I could proceed with an experience.  Yet we had traveled a great distance, and felt that 
introducing Sophia and Gregory to MDMA was such a promising opportunity that I could not 
refuse. 
<p>
It was gratifying to see Sophia again and meet Gregory.  We spent an evening visiting, 
and set the following day for our journey.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
We start by taking 120 m.g. each of MDMA on an empty stomach.  In twenty-seven 
minutes my head is clearing up miraculously.  The congestion is disappearing, my sinuses 
open and I breathe clearly.  After another twenty minutes, all the other bodily symptoms of 
my illness disappear and don't return all day!
<p>
The experience comes on strongly.  We have learned that this intensity occurs with 
exceptionally good companions.  We all move into an outstanding, euphoric state.  We are 
enormously gratified to be with each other.  We feel light, our voices are melodic, the skin 
smoothes and drops away the years, there is an outstanding feeling of grace.  We quietly enjoy 
easy communication.  It is snowing outside, and we feel very cozy together.  I feel a deep 
sense of Presence.  Sophia reports that the simplest blade of grass is as important as the huge, 
distant mountain.  Everything is all the same.  
<p>
Gregory feels some self-doubt.  He hadn't realized how invested he had become in a 
serious project he is undertaking and how it pushes him.
<p>
We all take a 40 m.g. supplement.  We proceed blissfully.  It goes so well that at the 
sign of wearing off, Sophia and Gregory ask for another supplement.  I am leery, as past 
experience has shown the uncomfortable effects of the second supplement outweigh any 
benefits.  But we feel so very good that we decide to do it anyway.  The experience continues 
delightfully and we notice no ill effects.  In fact, it is the richest, smoothest descent I have yet 
had from MDMA.  Jean and I keenly feel the goodness of our host and hostess.  [Because of 
the excellent result here, in a later investigation we once more tried a second supplement of 
MDMA.  This second time it only proved our original premise, that the second supplement is 
not worthwhile except in very optimum circumstances.]
<p>
In the afternoon, Sophia reports that she has been spending the time making wider and 
wider circles, each time including more within the circle.  Pain is the result of leaving 
something outside the circle.  Gregory was aware of what she was doing.  She faced all of her 
fears, including the death of her husband and her children.  She knows that all is well.  We are 
all elated with this experience.  
<p>
The following day finds us all very mellow.  Some of my flu symptoms return, but at a 
much lower level.  It is mostly just tiredness.  Gregory has encountered some vexing problems 
in his work situation, and finds that he handles them with considerably more balance and 
detachment.  
</div>
<p>
As Sophia drove us to the airport the second day after our journey, I found myself 
moving into a new state of celestial grace I had never before experienced.  In English we do 
not have an adequate vocabulary to deal with higher states of awareness, nor the experience to 
identify them.  I can only report that this level seemed somehow more pristine, more sacred, 
so much further beyond my usual ways of perceiving and feeling as to represent an entirely 
different level of celestial existence.  I was speechless; I could only hold still and be absorbed 
in this magnificent occurrence. I somehow knew that this enraptured state I had entered was 
related to the exceptional goodness of Sophia.  
<p>
<center>
<i>Pathology</i>
</center>
<p>
Jean and I were continually seeking suitable research subjects to extend our knowledge 
of the chemicals we were researching.  Mostly we were looking for interested, stable 
individuals whom we thought could well handle and enjoy the experience.  So I had to 
consider carefully when we were contacted by a college teacher who had been referred by a 
knowledgeable friend.  
<p>
The biographical data I had requested revealed a scattered, disorganized person with 
serious family problems.  This data, and the fact that his spouse did not wish to accompany 
him, were strong grounds for rejection.  But he was very persistent.  I was intrigued by our 
friend's assessment that we could be of help, even though years of conventional therapy had 
failed.  I also wanted to extend our experience into this area.  So we accepted.
<p>
<div class="inset">
Rudolpho, Jean and I each take 120 m.g. of MDMA.  The experience develops slowly, 
like a balloon lifting a heavy weight.  As the experience develops, Rudolpho shows us a photo 
album.  It contains not only pictures of his family, but a number of girl friends he has slept 
with.  In a short time he is extremely nauseous, and barely makes it to the john in time to 
vomit.  His face is quite gray.  He reports that he feels relieved from vomiting.  
<p>
I ask him what the vomiting is about.  He doesn't like his behavior, and doesn't want the 
double standard in his marriage.  He feels he knows what it is like to be his son, from whom 
he is estranged and who has some serious emotional problems.  
<p>
Rudolpho now feels quite relieved, and enjoys sitting in the sun.  At supplement time, I 
suggest a larger supplement for him, as I feel he has much to deal with.  He declines, and 
reluctantly accepts the normal 40 m.g. supplement.  He is now feeling so good that he sees no 
need to take a supplement.  He agrees only after I tell him the effects will soon wear off 
without a supplement, and that the supplement will simply continue the state he is in now, not 
intensify it.  
<p>
Rudolfo refuses to look at his central problem, but delights in being the center of 
attention and running on and on verbally.  In many years of Freudian psychoanalysis, he has 
learned to free associate.  He does this for the next few hours, rambling freely over feelings, 
thoughts, and perceptions, totally uninterested in our responses or remarks.  We listen for an 
hour, then remind him that the active part of the session will soon be over, and ask if he would 
like to address his problems.  He can hold his attention on them for only a few seconds before 
he wanders away.  After several unsuccessful attempts to redirect his focus, I realize that he is 
not going to attend his real issues, and we resign ourselves to listening.  I am awed at the 
depth of his self-centeredness.  Otherwise, we are all feeling quite good.  
<p>
I am very surprised later in the day when the heavy burden I feel Rudolfo is carrying 
lifts and is replaced by a very satisfying euphoria.  At this point Rudolfo feels normal and 
extremely clear-headed.  He asks my evaluation of his experience.  Earlier I had not wished 
to interfere with the spontaneous unfolding of his experience.  Now I begin to share my 
perceptions of how he has utilized the experience.  He seems open and understanding, so I feel 
he may wish to consider what I see are two of his major problems. However, he has little 
ability to stay focused on an issue.  I spend the rest of the time reflecting back his behavior in 
the moment so he can learn to catch himself at what he is doing to disrupt relationships.  Jean 
and I share our feelings and perceptions.  These center on his inability to listen, his total 
selfabsorption to the point of ignoring others and opportunities to learn, and the importance of 
acknowledging and appreciating others.  We hope some of it will seep through.  The 
discussion continues through the next day.  
</div>
<p>
We have no data as to the overall impact of this experience, and whether Rudolfo was 
able to improve the dynamics of his family relationships.  He left us much happier, content, 
and with apparently more understanding.  Jean and I learned a great deal about how distorted 
mental states can become, the power of investment in arbitrary belief systems, and how diffi
cult it is to make inroads into them.  Working with Rudolpho considerably improved the rela
tionship between Jean and me.  Seeing how bad things can get, she could acknowledge how 
much I had improved in overcoming some of the symptoms Rudolfo exhibited!

<i>Focusing Energy</i>
</center>
<p>
Ted is a bright young man, 31 years old.  On meeting, we soon found that we shared a 
great interest in psychedelics.  Ted had used them frequently and quite constructively.  As a 
result of what he learned in experiences, he decided on a career in the field of healing.  He 
first went back to finish college, and is now working on an advanced degree which will aid 
him toward his goal.  He plans to learn as much as possible through conventional study, and 
then use psychedelics to expand the frontiers of his knowledge.  I admire the course he has 
chosen, as I feel that this is the ideal way for young people who experiment with psychedelics 
to utilize these substances.  
<p>
We felt MDMA would be an appropriate substance to further our relationship. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
We all take 120 m.g. of MDMA.  Ted responds very quickly; Jean and I follow 
somewhat later.  It is an excellent takeoff.  The experience grows beautifully, as Ted is an 
excellent person to be with. 
<p>
We are developing a great deal of energy, more than I have previously experienced with 
MDMA.  Drawing on his knowledge of Hatha Yoga, Ted advises us to sit up straight, which 
focuses the energy.  Ted uses his yoga exercises to direct the energy into an uplifting 
experence.  After we all take a 40 m.g. supplement, Ted shows us how to breathe in, stretch 
and become very open to let the energy in, then deplete the breath.  Following this procedure 
we get very energized.
<p>
Ted then advises us to find a place in the body that feels good, and focus on increasing 
the good feeling.  I find this very effective in directing the experience positively.  I discover a 
choice point between letting the experience follow old normal patterns which get me into 
heavy feelings versus directing attention outward into new, exciting possibilities.  I find this 
process of letting the body express good feelings and then amplifying them a very effective 
way to dissipate the bogged down feelings I often encounter, and which I am experiencing a 
bit here. This procedure of expanding the good feeling produces an ecstatic state.
<p>
Later I make the surprising discovery that as long as I am directing my attention and 
working on something, the bliss inside continues to grow.  Previously I had always thought 
that it was flowing love that dissipated interior discomfort and created bliss; now it seems to be 
blissful regardless of what I focus on, as long as it is worthwhile.
<p>
We are all surprised by how this focusing activity has prolonged the experience and kept 
us in an advantageous space.  That evening I feel the strongest and most secure yet on 
MDMA.  Ted has been an excellent teacher.
</div>
<p>
I am putting these reports together several years after this experience took place.  I must 
confess that I have not remembered this technique well enough to apply it in later experiences.  
<p>
In the main, I have opted to directly confront my feelings and resolve them. This leaves me 
free, energized, and more knowledgeable.  As I review this experience, it is clear that the 
procedures recommended by Ted are worth further exploration.  
<p>

<i>Dissolving Walls of Anger</i>
</center>
<p>
Sarah and John are a couple that I had known many years previously.  They returned 
into our life seeking a psychedelic experience.  I felt that MDMA, which we were just 
beginning to research, would be appropriate for them. 
<p>
John is a fascinating person.  He is deeply steeped in Eastern religions.  But he lives a 
great deal in imagination, and is quite impervious to input from others.  Sarah is a dedicated 
wife as dictated by her European culture, but has long since given up trying to receive 
cooperation or support from John.  Her anger has grown to the extent that she hardly listens to 
anything he says.  She is usually quiet and withdrawn, suffering in silence. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
We all take 120 m.g. of MDMA.  In 45 minutes, Sarah becomes animated and begins to 
talk a lot.  She also begins listening carefully to John.  It isn't always easy to listen to him, as 
his explanations are circuitous and drawn out; it requires a lot of patience.  Sarah grows in 
strength and begins to express many of her concerns.  
<p>
After a 40 m.g. supplement, we are in a good space, talking freely and easily.  We 
spend the entire day simply talking and relating.  Sarah and John develop a new appreciation 
of each other.  Sarah notices something she has never experienced before.  She had always 
thought that John rambled on and on repetitiously without making any sense.  Now as she 
listens carefully, she is fascinated by his speech.  She notices an aliveness, a charm, and an 
insightfulness that had escaped her.  Her concentration makes it easier for her to understand 
what he is getting at, and she develops a true appreciation for a lot of the things he is 
discussing.
<p>
As the day goes on, it becomes quite clear that John's defenses are iron-clad, and that he 
has no desire to change.  I work hard to get him to be more appreciative of Sarah and more 
cooperative.  I reach a touchy boundary.  John has had a great deal of rejection in his life; if I 
push too hard it could alienate him and he will withdraw.  Yet it is to John's advantage to 
appreciate Sarah and give her space, so he can get some support back from her.  John does 
notice that Sarah is changing, and fetches a mirror so that she can see it.  I encourage him as 
much as I dare to take responsibility for Sarah's well-being.
<p>
An excellent bond forms among us all.  They have never been in such a salutary space, 
and are deeply appreciative of Jean and me.  We spend the next day talking and reviewing.  
John and Sarah become very close and develop a good understanding between them.  They feel 
better than they have in a long time, and are very grateful.  
</div>
<p>
This experience opened the door for them to continue work on their relationship with 
other helpers and to support each other.  They have both grown considerably over the 
following few years.                
<p>
<center>
<i>Wilbur and Donna</i>
</center>
<p>
Wilbur and Donna are both psychologists in their forties.  They are of remarkably 
different temperaments.  Wilbur is an extremely soft-spoken, highly sensitive, thoughtful 
person who keeps very much to himself.  However, he doesn't hesitate to speak very 
forthrightly whenever he is moved, and is totally undaunted by whatever another person might 
think, regardless or in spite of their recognized stature.
<p>
Donna, on the other hand, is a total love.  She is extremely open, outgoing, and a deeply 
caring person.  They make a marvelous couple.  They are both extremely bright and their 
attributes form an exquisite balance.  With a common client they can play good guy - bad guy, 
Wilbur providing almost scathingly accurate, penetrating observations of a person's 
difficulties, while Donna provides the caring, nurturing support to help the client adjust to 
such realities.  
<p>
In their youth they experimented with substances, but have not used them for a number 
of years.  They are intrigued by the descriptions of MDMA, which hold forth promise of a 
valuable experience without the discomfort of encountering painful, suppressed material which 
had spoiled previous experiences.  They decide to give it a try. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean takes 110 m.g. of MDMA, the rest of us take 120 m.g. each.  We are well into the 
experience in forty minutes, experiencing much euphoria, enthusiasm, youthful appearance, 
soft skin, easy communication, and enhanced beauty of perception.  Wilbur is called to an 
inner exploration.  He recalls an experience just before their marriage when an internal artery 
ruptured.  Nevertheless he was in a state of bliss.  He now feels this same bliss for the first 
time since that event.  Also, Wilbur is pleased that a severe pain he has been experiencing in 
his arm is subsiding.  He continues to search inside while the rest of us converse and listen to 
music. 
<p>
After a 40 m.g. supplement, we continue with great enjoyment, all being grateful for 
this very special time together.  Wilbur reports that it is easy to look at his difficult areas and 
resolve them.  He says, "you can look into the heart of anything."  Donna also finds that the 
experience is valuable for uncovering things.  She very much likes the centeredness and ability 
to focus, which is quite different from her mind-racing earlier experiences.  
<p>
I am very much aware of Wilbur's exceptionally fine mind and his enormous sensitivity.  
I tell him that he has immense potential. 
<p>
Two weeks later they repeated the experience on their own.  It deeply cemented their 
relationship and understanding and acceptance of each other.  Wilbur is very pleased with his 
new level of understanding, and Donna has made a quantum leap increase in aliveness.  While 
I have always appreciated her as an extremely nurturing person, I find an enhanced physical 
interest in her as a female.  
<p>
They both felt that they had learned so much that it was unnecessary to repeat the 
experience.  
</div>

<i>Rebonding a Marriage</i>
</center>
<p>
Denise and Blake are a couple we met when they visited Dr. Wolff.
We shared many common values, and they were interested in our research.  They had recently run into a very 
difficult situation in their marriage relationship, when one of them temporarily explored an 
alternate relationship.  Although they reconciled, the warmth between them seems permanently 
affected.  Hearing about the effectiveness of MDMA in relationships, they asked for a session.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean takes 110 m.g. of MDMA, Denise, Blake and I take 120 m.g. each.  The 
experience quickly grows in intensity, which is typical with good people.  Blake soon gets into 
a very good space.  Within 30 minutes he is looking out of the window and seeing the 
mountains in great clarity, beauty, and depth.  He is surprised at the depth because he sees 
well in only one eye.  Then everything melts into one, and he experiences enormous peace and 
harmony.  It is the experience of transcendence and oneness which he has actively sought, yet 
never before experienced.  He wishes to dwell in this, but feels he should give his attention to 
Denise.
<p>
Denise at first feels somewhat unsettled by the onrush of energy. Then she is amazed to 
find herself experiencing incredible love for Blake.  They fall into each other's arms with 
overwhelming love and deep bonding.
<p>
The remainder of the day they find themselves as youngsters in fresh young love, and 
explore the various dimensions of courtship.  They are enthralled with each other and deeply 
connected.  After a while their friends come into consciousness and are invited into their circle 
of love.  Later Blake experiences Jesus, Buddha, and other dignitaries joining them and 
supporting them.
</div>
<p>
This experience brought Denise and Blake together in closeness as they had never 
thought possible.  Their past difficulties were dissolved, and they continued their relationship 
in their new bond of love.  They were enormously grateful for this experience.  It made such 
an impact they have never felt it necessary to have another. 
<p>
<center>
<i>MDMA Plus LSD</i>
</center>
<p>
The combination of MDMA followed by LSD proved an extremely effective one.  Here 
is an outstanding experience, one of the subject's very best: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Ernesto is a young medical student doing intern work at a nearby hospital.  He had 
proven himself to be a very able user of the sacraments, and we have invited him and his wife 
Reina to join us for this research trial on a combination which is showing promise.
<p>
We all take 120 m.g. of MDMA on an empty stomach.  Our closeness has grown 
through several shared experiences, and now we are all more intoxicated than ever.  We are 
glowing, experiencing good feelings, animation, melodic voices, and expressive, youthful 
countenances.  We are very insightful as we discuss people that we know.  
<p>
At an hour and thirty-four minutes later, we each take 50 micrograms of LSD.  We 
begin to quiet down in 20 minutes and put on music.  Jean and Reina continue in the same 
beautiful state they were experiencing with MDMA.
<p>
Ernesto and I both begin to slide as the LSD comes on.  I feel the marvelous glow of 
centeredness and euphoria slipping away, a "thinning out."  It doesn't last long with Ernesto.  
The thinning stops, and his body becomes more light and expanded.  His vision is clear, more 
profound, and with greater detail.
<p>
This is the outstanding experience of Ernesto's life.  At the height of his experience he 
finds within himself a glowing ball of sheer power and love radiating with a white light.  This 
is the source of life.  He sees the same glowing ball in others.
<p>
Ernesto and Reina go off by themselves.  They return later, and Ernesto appears an 
entirely new person.  They had come together to seal their union, and after all the difficulties 
they had recently been through, it mobilized energy and shot Ernesto into a new space.  He is 
totally aware, amazingly insightful and enormously confident.  He is experiencing outstanding 
joy.
<p>
We have a wonderful interchange of discussion.  At one point we mention meeting a girl 
who had taken the Transcendental Meditation course on levitation, and claimed that her hop
ping around the room was levitation.  Ernesto is very exasperated that people should deceive 
themselves with such ideas when they have enormous power to develop themselves, improve 
their relationships, and be creative.
<p>
He asks Jean for a cup of tea, and she immediately rises to get it. "See," Ernesto says, "I 
levitated Jean.  There are lots of things we can levitate."
<p>
Ernesto is aware of the enormous power we have within us, and that all we have to do is 
apply it correctly.  Inspired by his positive approach, I look out the window and watch the 
light over the mountains which is the trail of the setting sun.  This light grows into an 
enormous power, and I too see the vastness of the central power of the universe, and how it 
flows out in love.  All traces of negative feelings within me evaporate and the rest of the day 
is blissful.  
<p>
I put on for Ernesto the selection from Handel's Messiah, A Son is Born.  It strikes him 
with enormous impact, as well as the rest of us.
<p>
Ernesto had previously had strong misgivings about leaving Mexico and his family.  He 
is now able to truly appreciate the United States and what it means to have a nation devoted to 
the freedom of the individual.  The impact of our nation's values affects the whole world.  I 
play a Fred Waring rendition of Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor.  The real meaning of our 
nation, opening the golden gates to the underprivileged of the world and offering them fresh 
opportunity, strikes us dramatically.  We are all overwhelmed with emotion.  What a loss it is 
to lose sight of our high principles by getting involved in the piddly affairs of everyday life.  
<p>
Ernesto had an interesting experience after returning to the hospital.  He reported that 
work flowed beautifully and insightfully, and saw many ways in which the inner power can be 
expressed in life.  
<p>
At one point, he got a feeling he should go to the Emergency Room.  There a doctor and 
two nurses were trying to insert an IV into an elderly diabetic.  The patient was so dehydrated 
that they could not find a vein, and had punctured her in a great many places without success.  
Ernesto suggested to one of the nurses that she insert the needle where two veins came 
together, so she could strike the fork.  The nurse laughed, knowing Ernesto as a fresh, 
inexperienced intern, while she had inserted needles thousands of times.  The doctor asked 
Ernesto to try.  He inserted the needle successfully on the first try.  The patient was 
enormously grateful.  Ernesto felt that he had been called to the Emergency Room to help her.  
<p>
Jean found this combination an outstanding experience.  Under the impact of the LSD, 
she was entirely taken over by the music.  She heard Dvorak's New World Symphony as 
though she had never heard it before.  Each note danced inside and outside of her, and she 
became the notes.
<p>
At the height of the MDMA experience Reina felt herself as being all things.  With the 
action of the LSD she began to bring everything back inside herself, finding a strong, inner 
core forming like a staunch rod.  Her thoughts became profound, and she could see more 
clearly as she focused on her work and her relationships.
<p>
For me, I realized how very important it is to focus my thinking and attention, which 
directs my power.  Then things flow readily and easily.  I saw that a clear way out of my pain 
is to focus my energy into meaningful activities.  
<p>
By usual standards, the amount of LSD which we imbibed was quite small.  Yet the 
impact on all of us was extraordinary.  For Ernesto, it was a rare +4 experience (see rating 
scale in Appendix II), a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.
. . . . . . .   
</div>
<p>
These are only a few of the many rewarding experiences we had with MDMA.  I wish to 
once more call attention to the fact that most of these experiences were unstructured.  
<p>
Preparation, intentional focusing, and repeated trials can considerably improve results. 
Recent information on MDMA is presented by Nicholas Saunders in his book E for Ecstasy.(11)
Saunders has gathered all of the information he could find on MDMA.  His book 
includes reviews of previously published material, as well as recent developments.  Included in 
the latter are the rave scene in England, psychotherapeutic work in Switzerland, and research 
projects in Britain.
<p>
As for our own work, we believe that almost any one of the trials we conducted would 
convince an objective observer that MDMA is a substance which holds enormous promise for 
improving the quality of life, and richly deserves careful investigation.  Becoming familiar 
with the full range of possibilities offered by this exceptional compound would make it hard to 
deny that it is one of life's remarkable graces.

<li>My hypothesis, derived from thirty years of observation of some five hundred 
experiences, is that the ingestion of a psychedelic substance releases layers of material that 
have been repressed in the unconscious.  The rate of release depends upon the dose level, how 
heavily these layers are defended, the focus of attention, and the intent of the subject.  But 
even with no focused attention, such layers are to some extent released, so that repeated 
experiences will continue the freeing process.  The occluded areas in the unconscious demand 
attention and can be the source of uncomfortable feelings.  Consequently as repeated 
experiences free these areas, the experience, and particularly the descent, becomes more 
comfortable, especially with MDMA.

<li>Karma is a fundamental concept in Eastern thought, and is literally translated as 
action.  It is held that our actions in life are influenced by our previous actions.  Inappropriate 
actions in the past will result in current inappropriate actions or experiences, whereas good 
acts will result in further good acts and experiences.  Jesus made a very similar statement, "As 
ye sow so shall ye reap."
<p>
Extensive experience with psychedelics reveals the enormous amount of material we 
repress.  It is this content that we attempt to resolve in dreams.  Research has shown that 
preventing sleepers from dreaming by waking them when they show the rapid eye movements 
that are correlated to dreaming causes them to become irritable and disturbed.  Some 
psychedelic experiences are like intense dreams as repressed material is released.  Our first 
Foundation published paper, The Psychedelic Experience, A New Concept in Psychotherapy" 
(see Appendix I for the reference), describes typical progress through successive stages of the 
experience.  As the unconscious material is resolved, the meaning and significance of the 
imagery become more apparent.  This correlates to dreams becoming more understandable and 
meaningful as we give them our conscious attention and work with them.  
<p>
I have chosen the term "negative karma" as an alternate way to describe inappropriate 
repressed material which must be resolved, or as Easterners would say, redeemed. 

<li>Eugene T. Gendlin.  <i>Focusing</i>.  New York: Bantam Books, 1981.<br>
Dr. Gendlin's book is a result of research at the University of Chicago to determine the factors that influence 
the rate of progress in therapy.  This book incorporates procedures learned from that research, 
and I highly recommend it.  The approach is intended to most rapidly and effectively elicit 
buried feelings and personal dynamics and resolve them.  It combines willingness to feel the 
buried feelings with the use of the intellect to most rapidly zero in on the heart of the problem.  
The subject is advised how to allow feelings to come up without resistance.  Then a "handle" 
is chosen -- a word, phrase, or image that best describes the feeling.  The subject then once 
again gives attention to the feeling.  The handle is rechecked against the feeling to see if it is 
still the best fit.  If not, it is changed.  Attention is given alternately to focusing on the feeling 
and the most appropriate handle.  In time a "felt shift" is experienced, which is the release of 
the feeling, often accompanied by valuable insights.  Procedures are clearly and thoroughly 
explained in the book, with advice on how keep the process going and deal with obstacles or 
other developments. 

<li>Dr. Franklin Merrell-Wolff -- philosopher, mathematician, mystic, and sage -- is 
known for having achieved spontaneous states of enlightenment through five progressive 
'Realizations.'  He wrote of his experiences in great detail and clarity in his two books:
<p>

New York:  Richard Smith, 1942.
<p>
<i>The Philosophy of Consciousness Without an Object: Reflections on the Nature of 
Transcendental Consciousness</i>.  New York:  Julian Press, 1973.  
<p>
Dr. Wolff lived the latter years of his life at the foot of the Sierra Nevada Mountains 
above Lone Pine, California.  His three hundred acre estate included housing where persons 
could come and stay and study his writings and extensive tape recordings and consult with 
him.
