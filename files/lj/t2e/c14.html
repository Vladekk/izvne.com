Chapter 14<br>
Story of a Marriage
</b>
</center>
<p>
I met my first wife, Jeanette, when I was 24 years old, during World War II.  Two years 
earlier I had been called to active duty as a reserve officer, but failed to pass the entrance 
medical examination or the appeal that followed.  I then found employment as a civilian 
engineer in the Navy Department, Bureau of Ships, in Washington, D.C. for the duration of 
the war. 
<p>
I had gone to a dance held at the local Jewish Community Center.  Among the dancers I 
spotted an especially attractive brunette who practically took my breath away.  Besides being 
beautiful, she was enormously poised, a trait that greatly appealed to me with my poor self-image.
I found out her name, and arranged to call on her. 
<p>
All went well, and soon we were dating.  I knew how badly my parents wanted me to 
marry a Jewish girl, but I had never met one that appealed to me.  Now the thought of 
marriage was extremely attractive, and it was only a few months until we wed. 
<p>
When I look back on my first marriage, I can't believe how naive I was.  I didn't know 
myself, I perceived very little of Jeannette's true characteristics, being content to project all 
kinds of fantasies upon her, and I knew nothing of male-female relationships or their potential.  
I was totally unprepared for marriage.  There should be schools for marriage.  Otherwise we 
are in the hands of that hard and sometimes cruel school that always teaches in the end, life 
itself.  
<p>
I had been very anxious to marry, and proceeded compulsively.  Starting with our 
honeymoon, I began to find out that Jeannette had many characteristics quite different than I 
had at first realized.  But like a good Jewish husband, I made the most of it.  We reared two 
children, a daughter, Harriet, and a son, Jerry.  I settled down to a conventional life as I 
pursued a successful career growing up with Ampex Corporation.  Ampex grew from nine 
people, a year after I first joined them, to 3500 employees when I left fifteen years later.
<p>
It wasn't until some twenty years later that I had my first inkling of what the possibilities 
might be between a man and a woman.  By this time I was frequently conducting psychedelic 
sessions.  I had the knack of soaking up all the negative feelings that were encountered by the 
person undergoing the experience, and I carried this around as a terrible burden.  In fact, I 
would spend my life learning how to get free of this dross.  Sitting in psychedelic sessions 
with clients was the hardest work I knew, and it left me continually tired. 
<p>
One evening I attended a meeting in Los Angeles at the invitation of my good friend, Al 
Hubbard.  The meeting had been arranged by his new friend Dolores, an extremely attractive, 
bright, sensitive, and personable young lady.  She had all of the qualifications we felt were 
required to supervise a new branch of our Foundation in Southern California.  She had 
gathered together a number of people who were curious about our work.  The meeting was 
interesting, but when it was over, Dolores noticed how tired I was.  She sat at one end of a 
sofa, and asked me to lie down and put my head in her lap.  I did, but I was totally unprepared 
for what happened.  
<p>
Almost instantly I was overcome by a sense of tranquility, and a wave of euphoria swept 
over me similar to the marvelous levels achieved in a good psychedelic experience.  I lay there 
full of peace, -- relaxed, content, and fulfilled.  This feeling stayed with me through much of 
the following day.  
<p>
I was astonished at what happened to me.  Then I realized that what I had contacted was 
Feminine Essence. I had experienced the true nurturing and fulfillment that comes from a 
female when conditions are right. 
<p>
What a remarkable discovery!  At last I had a glimpse of what true male-female relations 
could be.  No wonder there is so much fuss made about it in the world.  I wondered how 
many men truly realize this state of affairs.  I now knew that this is what we all hungered for, 
were desperate for.  It is the lack of it that drives us into all sorts of excesses.  Desperately 
wanting it, but pretending it is not important, we strive for mastery, for status, to be powerful, 
to control, to fight wars -- anything but admit our crying need for the comfort of this feminine 
essence.  
<p>
In one important sacramental experience, I realized how vital it is for our world leaders 
to have good marriages.  For if they are happy and fulfilled as men, they can with objectivity 
use their best talents to address the problems of their nation.  However, if they are unfulfilled, 
they are pushed to prove themselves in a variety of neurotic ways, with dire consequences to 
their country and perhaps the world. 
<p>
At any rate, this was a remarkable discovery for me, and greatly influenced my life from 
then forward.  I naturally went out immediately to prove whether this concept was correct.  I 
sought out the company of several different women (not simultaneously) who promised to 
exude this cherished elixir.  Sure enough, to be in their presence was wonderful and fulfilling.    
<p>
I could now clearly see one of the truly important conditions to be fulfilled for a happy 
life.  Unfortunately, this condition was not being met in my first marriage, and I never 
obtained enough wisdom to bring it about.  Our marriage ended in divorce in 1968.  
<p>
I met my current wife, Jean, in the spring of 1970.  At the time, I was working as a 
consultant for a firm just getting established in business.  This in itself was an interesting 
experience.  The firm was run by two Christian Scientists, which greatly satisfied me as 
meeting the Buddhists' principle of Right Livelihood.  They seemed to be wise, spiritually-oriented
persons of high principle.  However, this turned out to be a bitter distortion of the 
truth.  
<p>
The president was a very clever, smooth projection of a wise, compassionate, competent 
business person.  His very soft, low-key approach lured many investors into the company.  
And he was truly dedicated to God.  The only trouble was that he perceived God to be 
himself, which totally excused all the unjust and immoral actions that he took.  This led to 
some very interesting dilemmas within the company.  
<p>
For example, the sales-training course our company was marketing to veterans was 
required to be an accepted part of the curriculum of an accredited college.  This made it 
possible for the veteran to pay for the course out of Veterans Administration benefits.  Our 
president chose a school where he had close personal contacts and which would cooperate with 
him.  He was convinced that he could get the school approved by the Veteran's 
Administration. 
<p>
However, he was unable to do so.  Nor would he take steps to find an alternate school, 
so sure was he that he could get his way.  This meant that we produced hundreds of product 
kits for a market that had no funds to pay for them.  This led to the eventual demise of the 
company. 
<p>
One day two of my co-workers, Gus and Virginia, asked me if I wished to meet an 
attractive young lady.  Gus and Virginia had recently become husband and wife, and like so 
many happy couples, wished to share their joy by seeing others take advantage of their blissful 
state.  Jean was described as an attractive, personable lady who looked very good in a bikini.  
This struck me as a situation worth investigating, so the three of us accepted an invitation to 
dinner. 
<p>
As we drew up in front of the apartment house, there waiting at the head of a short flight 
of steps was a delightful young ten-year-old.  Slim, with a very attractive body and face, 
delightfully feminine, was Dede, Jean's daughter.  She gave a shy smile.  This made me quite 
eager to meet her mother.
<p>
Jean turned out to be a splendid cook, quite personable, and she danced with me as a 
perfect partner to the music of Glenn Miller, our favorite band.  I enjoyed being with her, and 
we began to see each other.  I could feel the warmth between us, which I had come to realize 
is so essential, and our relationship grew into courtship, and then into marriage.  
<p>
Looking back, it was a hasty marriage, as we had known each other only five months.  
But I was very compulsive, and once setting myself on a desired goal, I had neither the 
patience nor inclination to let in more data.  The bottom line was that we were both lonesome 
and starved for companionship, and ready to commit ourselves to this relationship.  
<p>
Once the need for companionship and physical needs are satisfied, other aspects of the 
relationship come into view.  It soon became apparent that there were considerable differences 
in our interests, values, and aspirations.  
<p>
I was an extremely serious person, putting top priority on personal growth and expansion 
of awareness.  I was very curious, and had a powerful drive to know and understand.  My 
accomplishment in these directions was limited only by my cowardice, which was quite 
appreciable.  I moved in a circle of friends who shared my growth aspirations, and we spent 
much time examining our personal dynamics and how we could further self-understanding.  
<p>
Jean had a natural talent for enjoying life, and simply accepting the flow of life.  She 
deemed it unnecessary to analyze.  Nor was she very concerned about what made things work.  
She was bright, but not curious to understand a number of areas.  This included politics, logic, 
and equipment like automobiles, stereos, and VCRs.  Probably at the bottom of this was a
self-consciousness at not having gone further in college, and a resistance to revealing her 
ignorance.  She covered this feeling by deciding such things were not high priority. 
<p>
This of course negated many of the things I believed in, and made it difficult for her to 
appreciate my native gifts or accomplishments.  I acutely felt this lack of acknowledgment, 
and in turn keenly resented her for her lack of support.  On the other hand, she strongly felt 
my judgmentalness and criticism.  She constantly felt either put down or left out of my 
considerations.  We were continually at odds with each other, always immediately taking 
opposite sides of any issue.  Our friends were alternately amused and annoyed at our constant 
bickering. 
<p>
There were some ways in which we were very much alike.  We were both very 
independent, and easily absorbed in our chosen activity.  I spent as much time as I could find 
writing, and Jean developed considerable skill in water colors.  In time she had her own studio 
adjacent to our house, and was producing excellent work.  She had a particular flair for 
choosing and flowing colors, which gave an ephemeral, transcendental aura to many of her 
landscapes.  She enjoyed very much exhibiting her work and was delighted when her works 
were purchased.  
<p>
We both loved nature, and enjoyed hikes into the mountains.  We were delighted with 
the location of our home, and the proximity to outstanding natural settings.  When traveling, 
we could drive for hours with little conversation, each being absorbed in the beauty of the 
surrounding countryside.  This joy was considerably enhanced as our perceptions were 
heightened through the use of psychedelics.  To this day I consider it one of life's great 
privileges to drive in an automobile through interesting countryside, and to simply drink in the 
surroundings while listening to good music. 
<p>
But despite these respites, our dissatisfactions continued to grow.  In fact, our 
relationship would have been hopeless in other circumstances.  We built up enormous 
resentments toward each other, and lost any sense of affection and mutual support.  Our 
animosity grew to the point where it was very uncomfortable just to be with each other.  
Sleeping beside her at night, it often felt like a poisonous fluid was flowing from her body to 
mine.  This seemed like a bitter toxin that pervaded my muscles and joints, causing tension, 
aching, and arthritis.  I felt that if I didn't resolve this it would kill me.  
<p>
There were times when we would tear each other down to the point that we felt it 
impossible to live together, and threatened to part.  Yet when the reality of leaving sunk in, we 
decided that what we had was better than being alone, and agreed to give it another try.  So 
cowardice was one of the things that held us together.  
<p>
The other factor that kept us together, and by far the most important, was the use of the 
sacraments.  MDMA (see Chapter 3) was a huge contributor here.  In the state of grace 
proffered by this remarkable substance, we moved into a state of love and beauty that made the 
whole world a paradise.  Jean called it "The Great Eraser."  After a number of trials with this 
substance, I arrived at a list of "the usual symptoms."  We would usually begin to feel the 
effect of the drug in about twenty minutes.  Once felt, the intensity increased rapidly.  There 
would be a rush of energy which could be a bit unsettling, except that for us the euphoric 
components always told us that we were heading in a good direction.  At about the hour point, 
the rush feeling would subside, leaving us in a marvelous state approaching ecstasy.  There 
was utter clarity of perception, with colors brilliant and everything standing out in sharp detail.  
Many times while starting a fire in the woodstove, I was startled by the crisp, clear, high 
frequency sounds made by crumpling the paper. 
<p>
The outdoors was charged with energy and brilliant light, everywhere revealing the 
Presence of the Celestial Level.  Everything seemed remarkably natural and at Peace, and in 
harmony with all else.  As we looked at each other, we seemed fifteen years younger.  
Wrinkled skin would become smooth and very soft to the touch.  An inner beauty shone forth.  
Within we felt whole, at peace, and pervaded by love.  We were in love with everything that 
we saw.  Everyone exuded kindness; problems evaporated.  Everything seemed perfect the 
way it was.
<p>
The person who introduced us to this remarkable substance calls it Window.  And rightly 
so, for it is like looking through a window at the world the way it should be, as the Creator 
intended it to be.  Love, Peace, Beauty, Wonder, Harmony, Unity, Wisdom, Mystery.  And 
such utter content.  It was a joy to be with your companions.  It didn't matter what you did or 
what you talked about or if you remained quiet, it was so joyful and peaceful to just be 
together.
<p>
While MDMA did not lend itself to introspection as readily as some other substances, it 
did permit a great deal of clarity and self-understanding if one were motivated to turn his/her 
attention in this direction.  Problems were accurately perceived and their solutions apparent.  
There was a remarkable tendency when in this state to feel superbly whole and with no need to 
defend oneself.  Differences with others could readily be discussed with remarkable freedom 
and insight.  
<p>
The opportunity for defense-free communication and insight was not well utilized by 
Jean and me.  When she was in the state of glory, she chose not to tarnish it by bringing up 
anything with a flavor of negativity.  So we never discussed the problems between us.  But it 
was indelibly impressed upon both of our minds how life could be.  So even though a few days 
after such an experience we began to revert to our old habits, we still had in mind the model of 
what could be, and we were frequently moved to attempt to bring this model into reality.  
Without these exposures and the experience of the possible, I have no doubt that our marriage 
would have fallen apart early.  
<p>
For quite a few years we were engaged in research with several of the new psychoactive 
agents.  Our objective was to learn how a larger number of subjects would react to substances 
that we had found valuable in our own experiences.  This kept us sharing journeys with others 
at a frequency of once every one to two weeks.  These experiences were most rewarding and 
enjoyable, and greatly helped screen our private differences.  And we continued to be exposed 
to more of our own inner dynamics and make progress in our personal growth. 
<p>
I fell into a syndrome that continued for a number of years.  Following the experiments 
with substances, I would be in an exalted state, loving and understanding.  But over a period 
of days I would become exasperated with the dynamics going on between us, so that by the 
time of the next session, I was fairly loaded with resentment and hostility.  I would work this 
off in the next experiment, often accompanied by much greater understanding. 
<p>
As I grew to know myself better, I began to see that I was extremely self-centered and 
very much preoccupied with myself.  I considered my work to be of prime value, and tended 
to devalue Jean's verbal contributions. I could practically feel the wall by which I shut her out.  
I began to see how painful this was to her.  Furthermore, I became aware that it was my 
experiencing her feelings of pain and resentment which was the cause of much of the bad 
feelings I felt when around her.  It began to dawn on me that in order to feel good,
I needed to see to it that she felt good. 
<p>
Another important discovery came from my feelings of disappointment in Jean.  I 
yearned for more affection, more acknowledgment, more genuine interest.  But as I looked at 
these feelings, I saw that I was producing the same feelings in her!  I began to appreciate that 
it may be a cosmic law that my uncomfortable feelings are not those of the other person, but 
my very own.  And the uncomfortable feelings arise from the way that I am treating the other 
person.  These realizations helped a great deal in improving our relationship. 
<p>
I worked very hard, it seemed to me, to overcome these difficulties and direct her more 
love and consideration and acknowledgment.  However, I was very disappointed that I was 
receiving very little response from her.  So my yo-yo existence continued for some time.  
Through sacramental experiences, I would reach stages of forgiveness and love, and all 
seemed well.  Yet within a week or so the "cruddy" feelings would build up again.  It seemed 
extremely difficult to become free.  At times I wondered if I weren't squandering my life and 
well-being by being with the wrong partner.  Yet as I addressed this, I realized that I had not 
achieved a sufficient level of love.  I had been shown over and over that we are all One, that 
every living being is part of me, and that the welfare of any individual is my welfare.  And 
since my goal was to achieve unconditional love and to relinquish my judgments of others, I 
surely had to do this with the person I was living with!!  Again and again when in the highest 
states of being and I could feel my concerns for the whole world, the realization would come 
to me that it was senseless to think of helping the world if I couldn't get along with my own 
wife! 
<p>
There were two kinds of experiences that helped correct this situation. One of the most 
impressive experiences I ever had with Jean was during a New Year's celebration when we 
were sharing a journey with Manual and Selma and three other very close friends.  We had 
achieved a high level of realization.  I looked at Jean and she was incredibly beautiful.  I saw 
her face change from one form of femininity to another, each more wonderful that the last, the 
very essence of beauty, tenderness, nurturing, sensuousness.  She laughed and smiled and 
showed me many delightful faces.  I was overcome with love for her, and felt enormous 
gratitude and good fortune to have her as my wife.  
<p>
This experience faded in a few days, and as I began in my own development to 
encounter deep shadow material, involving the release of deep, deep anger, it became very 
difficult to reexperience this vision.  But I knew it was there, and had a goal toward which to 
work. 
<p>
More profound and helpful was learning in journeys to tune into her Essence.  When this 
was successful, I was overcome with the joy and delight of participating in her being.  Often 
her nurturing and love would wipe away any discomfort I was experiencing, and a great love 
would grow between us.  We could look together upon the world and experience the vast 
beauty, meaning, and joy.  In this close contact, the joy and fulfillment was always greater 
than what I could experience alone.  I knew that if I could learn to enter this state at will and 
maintain it, we would have a marvelous marriage.  
<p>
With the availability of 2C-E (see Chapter 6), my personal growth and learning 
accelerated considerably.  A characteristic of this substance with me was that intense, inner, 
negative feelings surfaced to consciousness.  In fact, there was no escape.  So I would simply 
stay with them until they were resolved.  I found these experiences remarkably cleansing, and 
afterwards felt keenly rejuvenated, more than with any other substance.  
<p>
As we cut back on our research work, Jean and I began to have more experiences with 
just the two of us.  This required us to confront each other directly, and led to more rapid 
progress.  Also, Jean was opening up a great deal, and was more willing to deal with her own 
personal dynamics.  
<p>
For some time it was difficult for me, as much of the day I would so experience my 
repressed resentments that it was hard to become close.  But we always managed to arrive at 
closeness by day's end.  Change is extremely difficult, but it became more and more obvious 
that I had to alter these feelings of resentment.  Fortunately, in time and with repeated 
experiences, and with the help of meditation practice, I was able to do so. 
<p>
Here is a typical experience we shared together which contributed greatly to our 
understanding of each other and brought us closer: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean joins me on the sofa, and I spend some time looking at her.  I allow myself to be 
open and non-judgmental, and simply observe.  I discern a great many things about her, and 
become aware of the push I exert for her to be different than she is.  I drop this to simply see 
what she is of herself.  At one point I realize that we are each every man and every woman, 
and become fascinated with how we choose certain faces and dynamics to present to each 
other.  In a sense it doesn't make any difference who your partner is, if you can learn to 
present to each other the most interesting and desirable aspects.  
<p>
I become aware that there are flaming sexual energies within us both.  I can see that Jean 
has generated enormous resentment toward me for frustrating her energies by being so 
absorbed within myself and not fully expressing myself sexually.  I in turn do not choose to 
express myself completely because of my resentments over certain aspects of our relationship.  
So I take refuge in seeking satisfaction from inner feelings generated by more deeply 
contacting my inner being.  We can do a great deal for each other by freeing these energies 
and expressing them to each other.  
<p>
As I look over the various facets we can present each other, I wonder if I can see the 
highest aspects of Jean.  I carefully watch, not pushing, and her beauty begins to reveal itself.  
For a while I am filled with the grace of the essence of her being, manifested in a wonderful 
radiance.  This is most satisfying, but not easy to keep present.  
<p>
An underlying feeling of extreme tiredness has pervaded both Jean and me throughout 
the day.  When we decide that our groveling time is over, we put on some music and dance.  
It is remarkable how the flow of energy carries us to new dimensions, releasing wonderful 
feelings and understandings that do not come while lying down and breathing through the 
discomforts.  This is a compelling experience. 
</div>
<p>
At last we reached the stage where we began to genuinely enjoy each other.  Forgiveness 
became real, and we committed ourselves to treating each other with kindness and concern.  
The result was a growth in the energy flow between us which became sustaining and 
energizing.  
<p>
<center>
. . . . . . .
</center>
<p>
One of the very intriguing developments is how, despite our differences, the sensual 
pleasures of lovemaking grew with time.  Starting a few years ago, I experienced a reduction 
in potency.  I ascribed this to advancing age, the possible effects of a prostate operation, or 
even the claim made by some of the adverse effects of a vasectomy as one grows old.  All of 
these concerns evaporated as Jean and I accepted each other and moved into real caring and 
intimacy. 
<p>
I remain convinced that the most significant factor involving sensual pleasure is the 
emotional closeness of the partners.  Hostility and resentment are real killers of profound 
sexual enjoyment.    
<p>
One incident stands out as an illustration of the dynamics involved in achieving 
closeness.  Jean and I spent a week in a meditation retreat with Alan Wallace, our teacher of 
Tibetan Buddhist meditation.  My meditative experiences improved considerably, as well as 
my ability to be at peace in the moment.  
<p>
Jean left shortly after the retreat for a week in the Bay Area visiting her daughter and 
grandchildren.  During her absence I experienced the greatest contentment ever while alone.  
Nevertheless, I was eagerly looking forward to Jean's return. 
<p>
I was delighted to see her when she arrived home.  I immediately felt the warmth of her 
presence.  But then I was suddenly struck with a sickening sensation.  The heavy, miserable 
feelings I used to feel in her presence that had plagued me for years were back in full force!  
This was a disastrous blow.  I felt I had made enormous progress in dissipating these feelings.  
Now I must rethink my progress, my goals, and decide about the future.  I certainly didn't 
want to continue life carrying this burden.  But I also didn't want to live alone.  Was there any 
way to solve this problem? 
<p>
On my daily afternoon walk with our two dogs, I prayed deeply about it.  I saw that 
there was a lot I was still demanding of Jean, hoping that she would cooperate to achieve the 
remarkable state of union between us I knew was possible.  It was clear that my intensity and 
manipulating were creating the discomfort.  The union I so fervently wished for necessitated 
the agreement of both parties.  I couldn't force her to do it.  I had to let her proceed in her 
own way at her own pace.  This realization eased my state of being considerably.  
<p>
I slept alone that night and the next morning Jean joined me in bed.  Immediately I felt 
the miserable feelings as though they were flowing directly from her body into mine like 
toxins.  I simply relaxed, accepted it, and stayed with it.  It continued to grow in intensity 
until it was unbearable.  I prayed desperately to be shown a way out, or to at least understand 
what the feeling was.  
<p>
I began to feel a focus of a sharp pain, and immediately willed myself into it.  
Simultaneously I remembered that when I woke up in the middle of the night I was on the 
edge of an extremely frightening experience.  This also had been plaguing me for years, and 
especially as I had grown older.  I often woke up in the middle of the night in deep, 
agonizing, inexplicable feelings, the worst of the whole day.  I had grown used to them, and 
had dropped my concern about them, since once I was up and around they disappeared, and I 
was able to conduct myself in a comfortable and often joyous state.  
<p>
But this morning as I experienced the sharp pain and remembered my nocturnal miseries, 
the two came together.  I suddenly realized I was experiencing deeply within Jean the 
enormous pain of being unloved.  The feeling was a desperate, anguished cry for love that 
soon spread throughout all of humanity.  Humans everywhere, including myself, are agonized 
at the emptiness of our inner being. 
<p>
I saw the need to fill this emptiness in Jean with love.  I began to flow love to her, and 
as I did, God joined me and supplied His infinite reservoir of love.  I could feel love flowing 
into all the compartments of her being.  The miserable feelings dissolved and I was feeling 
only the wonder of God's love, and His capacity to wipe away the deepest suffering.  
<p>
I realized this would be still more effective by expressing love through physical 
lovemaking.  We came together in the most sensuous, wonderful, love-filled experience that I 
can remember.  My mind was filled with Jean completely, and I did everything possible to 
convey tenderness, pleasure, and nurturing.  It was an outstanding experience. 
<p>
Then I realized I wished to be nurtured too, and I felt her nurturing essence begin to fill 
me.  The joy and pleasure reached tremendous new heights as we were both being filled.  
Then suddenly the nurturing stopped flowing into me, and despite the most pleasurable 
stimulation, I lost my potency.  I was yearning for completion, but the energy wasn't 
available. 
<p>
I relaxed and I thought, "This is really karma."  For many times in the past I had been 
completed and fulfilled when Jean was not.  Now it was my turn to be left unfulfilled.  But the 
yearning rapidly subsided as we relaxed into the joy of being together and sharing our warmth 
and love.  And there would soon be a next time.  
<p>
A very interesting thing that Jean shared with me was that at the beginning when I was 
sinking into misery, she was having the most enjoyable time ever being next to me.  It was 
because I was so relaxed, and not trying or pushing!
<p>
The use of the sacraments played an important role in the progress of our lovemaking.  
The sacraments were very effective in amplifying sensuousness and intimacy, so that 
lovemaking continued to grow in pleasure and satisfaction.  While the amplification of 
pleasure is highest while under the influence, much of the enhancement becomes permanent. 
<p>
In the early stages of our marriage, when we each held considerable anger toward the 
other, the joy of lovemaking would often be followed by languidness or tiredness. Sometimes 
this would even get as strong as revulsion.  Sexual hunger is a powerful drive, and sexual 
satisfaction is one of life's greatest pleasures.  So lovemaking continues in many relationships 
long past the time of true affection.  There are no doubt countless marriages in which the sex 
drive is the only thing that holds the couple together, and may be the only bit of pleasure 
derived from the relationship. 
<p>
In my own case, during the time when I yearned for more understanding and affection, I 
felt I was violating my integrity by making love to a partner for whom I felt no affection.  
This created enormous self-hatred. 
<p>
Our marriage improved substantially as I began to appreciate Jean's true nature.  I 
caught up with my personal dynamic of putting Jean down instead of facing the very difficult 
task of changing my deeply ingrained habits.  These habits centered on my self-absorption, 
shutting Jean out and not acknowledging her, and my unwillingness to relinquish my 
judgmental, critical attitude, as well as my resentments.  
<p>
Much of my resentment was grounded in a deep, powerful self-hatred which I did not 
care to confront.  It is much easier to project self-hatred onto those around you.  I think it is a 
psychological truth that those to whom we are the closest and can therefore trust the most are 
often the target of our most severe projections. 
<p>
My inability to hold on to the superior states of well-being that resulted from the use of 
the sacraments and from good meditations forced me to realize I had to break these habits.  
As I was able to do so, true affection began to grow. 
<p>
As we opened to each other, it became possible to experience closer and closer the core 
of the other's being.  This made it possible to feel a deeper, more profound love.  It kept 
increasing in intensity until it became nurturing and fulfilling.  
<p>
I began experiencing more frequently the Feminine Essence mentioned earlier in this 
chapter.  I believe that men can perceive this as a nurturing, enrapturing nectar that fills us 
with consummate fulfillment, a peace and ecstasy that is beyond describing.  It is what our 
nature calls for, yearns for.  And it is available only by opening ourselves completely to our 
partner, allowing love to penetrate our being without reservation. 
<p>
Such opening to one another allows the essence of our beings to bond deeply, to unite us 
in the most heart-felt love.  And this in turn remarkably enhances lovemaking.  This intimacy 
not only heightens the joy of all physical contact, but results in a healing, nurturing exchange 
of energy that charges us for the day.  In the glow of such fulfillment, it is easy to see the 
remarkable beauty of life in all that surrounds us. 
<p>
While many of the world's spiritual disciplines lay a path to ultimate fulfillment through 
solitude, I must report that every step that I have been able to accomplish has been a great 
deal more fulfilling in harmony with a loving partner.  In view of the crippling obstacles that 
once polluted Jean's and my relationship, it is most satisfying to discover the affection and 
support that open the door to higher appreciation of the wonders around us.  Again and again I 
express my gratitude for the intuition that helped me recognize that the difficulties were within 
myself, and for the forces that helped me gather the determination to keep working on the 
factors that kept us apart.  Now there is the gratifying satisfaction of having a partner who is a 
true companion, a true helpmate -- one who makes it possible to appreciate the blessings of 
life.  This is living at its utmost.
