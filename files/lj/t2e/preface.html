<b>Preface</b>
</center>
<p>
Sigmund Freud has postulated that there lies within each of us a drive for death.  As we 
see the self-destructive tendency operating wide-spread throughout humankind, it is easy to 
accept the reality of such a drive.  I have certainly found it functioning with great strength 
within myself. 
<p>
This book is the story of how I overcame thanatos, the drive for death, to elicit eros, the 
drive for life.  
<p>
The informed use of psychedelic substances has been a key element in my personal 
growth.  The material presented here is not intended in any way to encourage the use of illicit 
substances.  Nor for that matter, the uninformed use of any substance, licit or illicit.  The 
substances described in this book are powerful, and can easily be misused.  They should be 
employed only with integrity and a thorough knowledge of their characteristics, both benefits 
and adverse affects. 
<p>
I believe these pages contain ample evidence to support the value and usefulness of such 
substances.  I hope that this evidence will encourage rational efforts toward further scientific 
exploration of these materials and the establishment of procedures to take advantage of their 
remarkable potential. 
<p>
I am confident that in time, we will learn to use psychedelic substances to explore many 
aspects of science, art, history, psychology, and spirituality.  The dimensions of the mind that 
can be realized are limited only by our willingness to enter them; eons of fascinating 
exploration await us.
<p>
Curious investigators focus on the particular areas that appeal to them.  I have confined 
my own explorations within the framework of two major paradigms:  psychotherapy and 
spirituality.  My motivation is simple.  Most of my life I have experienced very uncomfortable 
feelings.  My primary motivation is simply to feel good.  To accomplish this, I found great 
assistance through understanding my own personal psychic dynamics.  This taught me to 
comprehend my values and behavior, and what I could do to achieve a more comfortable, 
satisfying, fulfilling life.  
<p>
Even more helpful was my willingness to discover and draw upon the essential healing 
forces of the universe.  By focusing on the innate life force, I found it possible to realize a 
level of wisdom, understanding, and universal love that I had not previously known possible.  
<p>
Consequently my personal explorations generally focused on spiritual development.
<p>
Many other avenues of exploration are possible, and some of them show up in the 
experiences reported here.  As psychedelic substances are better understood, the eager, 
dauntless explorers of modern times will range over these new, uncharted seas, and return with 
great treasures.

Acknowledgments
<p>
I am deeply indebted to many dear friends for making the personal adventure described 
in this book possible.  There are wise ones who provided counsel and guidance, companions 
who shared deeply in the processes reported here, and courageous individuals willing to 
explore with little-known substances to extend our knowledge.  
<p>
Extremely important for me personally have been those intimate friends in special groups 
who provided a centering, stabilizing force for accurate perception.  A major danger in 
psychedelic use is to become enamored with one's own inner, subjective experience.  Often 
exploring alone in a remote area, I sometimes gave undue weight to such creations.  I was 
frequently rescued from erroneous conclusions by recognizing the accuracy and ingenuity of 
the perceptions of my companions.  I'm especially grateful for this most important discovery:  
<p>
I find the most enjoyable, stimulating, and fulfilling state in which to function is within the 
common meeting place of minds.
