Chapter 5<br>
Other New Compounds
</b>
</center>
<p>
A large number of compounds have been discovered which are psychoactive.  Jean and 
I have had the opportunity to try several of them, and found a few that were outstanding in 
their characteristics and warranted further attention.  We describe below some of the results on 
compounds with which we had the most experience, as well as some that we liked but did not 
have the opportunity to investigate further. 
<p>
<center>
<i>MEM</i>
</center>
<p>
My first trial of MEM, code name for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyamphetamine, was not 
overly impressive.  It revealed the characteristics of a good psychedelic, but demonstrated 
nothing to indicate an advantage over a number of other good compounds.  We did find, 
however, that it had outstanding attributes when preceded by MDMA. 
<p>
The first trial of MDMA followed by MEM was with a group and was quite successful.  
It was the most enjoyable experience so far with this particular group.  For the first time I felt 
no discontinuity in the transition from MDMA to the second substance.  There followed a 
most delightful afternoon of intimate sharing, good communication, hilarity, and deep 
appreciation of one another.  The experience continued until midnight.  Most important, the 
changes involving inner strength, solidarity, and peace carried on much longer than any 
previous experience.  
<p>
With this very moving result, we were anxious to continue investigating this 
combination.  We soon repeated the experience, just Jean and I.  Again I found it an 
uninterrupted continuation of the MDMA experience.  We had our most detailed discussion to 
date, clarifying a lot of our history and feelings, ever growing closer.  We found that MEM 
has great power, continuing without letup for hours, well into the night (we started at ten 
a.m.).  We had good physical control, and could do whatever we wished in terms of tasks. 
Yet the experience was intense.  When we retired, we grew into a closeness never before 
experienced, a superb encounter that united our inner beings.  
<p>
With this data, we wished to expand our knowledge of this combination with other 
subjects.  Several cases are reported below. 
<center>
<i>An Occluded Case.</i>
</center>
<p>
Ken is a 28 year old musician, earning his living as a computer operator in a small 
business firm.  He has had MDMA three times with his guide, who joins us now.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
He and the guide take 130 m.g. of MDMA followed by a supplement of 45 m.g.  Three 
hours after the start we all take 20 m.g. of MEM.  Two hours later Ken and I take 10 m.g. 
more, as I find the going very heavy.  [Additional chemical is required to overcome heavy 
resistance or blockages.]
<p>
We make a very close and productive group.  Ken is very honest, and likes candid, 
intimate discussion.  As we share with each other, we are drawn very close.  We make the
transition to MEM with no loss of the euphoric and centering MDMA feeling.  
<p>
Our discussion continues unabated through the afternoon and evening, pushed by a 
powerful drive from the MEM.  It is the most intense, continuing discussion I have 
participated in.  We all learn a great deal from each other and continue to draw closer.  A 
major point of the discussion is whether or not Ken should drop his rather pedestrian job to 
concentrate on his music.
<p>
That night I am very restless, as I feel we failed to reach resolution, despite the power 
and drive of the substance.  Ken does not reach his deep inner feelings, and I feel a heavy wall 
between us.  The following morning I see Ken as a very sensitive person struggling to come to 
terms with his inner self; he needs much time and support.  On a walk the next morning we 
have excellent, free communication, and the wall I feel dissolves.  We both feel much power.  
</div>
<p>
Jean and I believe this combination has enormous impact with unusual strength.  It is 
long lasting, and keeps one working away at his/her difficulties.  Ken was carrying a heavy 
psychic burden, and succeeded in freeing himself from much of it.  
<p>
<center>
<i>Resolving a Marriage.</i>
</center>
<p>
Liz is a 26 year old girl, very attractive, outgoing and full of spunk.  She is in an 
unfortunate marriage, where the partners are quite different and have a difficult time 
appreciating each other.  Liz has strayed from the path and now realizes it will not work out.  
But does she want to continue in her present marriage?
<p>
We have several days of good, open discussion, in which Liz reviews her feelings and 
options.  She asks for this experience to reach and know her deeper feelings. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
We all take 120 m.g. of MDMA, and it exhibits its usual positive effects.  1-2/3 hours 
later we take 20 m.g. of MEM.  The transition to MEM is smooth except for Liz, who has a 
lot of discomfort.  She feels her problem is making her whole body uncomfortable.  She is 
achy, has a headache and back pain.  She struggles with this all day, not feeling any resolution 
and not feeling like talking.  She is slowly working things out.  She feels quite tired most of 
the day, which affects Jean and me.  It is a hard working day.
<p>
While Liz is working, I take her 2-1/2 year old son for a walk.  He is a great teacher.  I 
find him remarkably bright and in tune.  He knows exactly when I divert my attention from 
him, and when I am not completely truthful with him.  He soaks up information, new words, 
and new procedures like a hungry sponge, as long as I give him my complete attention.
<p>
I have an outstanding day, seeing Jean's celestial beauty and experiencing the 
indescribable essence of female.  The driving power of the MEM lasts all night.  To be 
comfortable, I have to keep focusing the power outward, flowing love into situations, to 
people I know, to healing the world.  This is extremely cleansing and uplifting.  I awake the 
following morning feeling elated, body cleansed and in a very sound, stable place.  
<p>
I am concerned that Liz might have been pushed too hard by this combination.  She 
awoke with a bad cold and was tired.  She slept in.  When she arose she felt she had resolved 
the situation, and wanted to continue the marriage if her partner agreed.  She is glad for the 
experience and found it helpful.
</div>
<p>
Two days later, Liz has well integrated this experience.  She feels very good and has 
high resolve.  She reported that she knew all the time what the outcome would be, but had to 
clear away the feelings of anger, disappointment, and pain until her true feelings could come 
in strongly.  She abandoned thinking to simply letting go of her feelings and letting them work 
through.  Talking to her husband on the phone, when he reported that he was eager to have her 
back, all the achiness in her body suddenly ceased.  
<p>
Jean and I both felt a new power and confidence in Liz, like a quantum leap forward.  
<p>
The marriage didn't last; it broke up six months later.  But Liz had found excellent 
strength to deal with all the contingencies.  Two years later she found a much more 
compatible mate.  They are living together happily, and have three more children between 
them.  
<p>
<center>
. . . . . . .
</center>
<p>
After the two above experiences, I wrote to friends describing my evaluation of this 
combination:  
<p>
<div class="inset">
At this point, I feel that the MDMA-MEM combination is the most powerful therapeutic 
combination that we have.  Compared to the MDMA--2C-B combination, which we also hold 
in excellent regard, the MEM combination has a smoother transition into the second substance, 
so that it is more of a continuation of the MDMA state.  The MEM is more centering, like 
MDMA, which makes it easy to work with and yet permits normal functioning on physical 
tasks.  There seem to be less side-avenues and body effects than with 2C-B.  There is a 
powerful push from the substance which keeps one working in a positive direction for a 
number of hours.
<p>
A possible drawback is that it may push people into areas for which they are not ready.  
Consequently subjects should be well motivated to address their problems if they wish to 
employ this combination.
<p>
While the body feels good and cleansed afterward, a lot of work has been done and there 
is quite a drain on the body.  Recovery of full energy may take several days. 
</div>
<p>
<center>
<i>Sabrina.</i>
</center>
<p>
Sabrina, our beloved adopted daughter, is moving out of the area to a new location 
where we will most likely seldom see her.  In her new location, she will be able to conduct her 
practice as a midwife with proper medical supervision.  We are having one last experience 
together to give her a chance to evaluate the new combination we feel is so effective.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean, Sabrina, and I take 120 m.g. of MDMA.  We have preceded this two hours earlier 
with a 600 m.g. capsule of potassium chloride (Micro-K Extencaps) which we have found 
reduces the dehydration effects of MDMA and results in more comfortable body feelings.  We 
quickly move into a beautiful, loving experience with much warmth and closeness.  We walk 
to the spot where Sabrina had once erected a teepee, and then to the sweat lodge she had 
constructed.  Both of these are very important to the Native American Indian work to which 
Sabrina feels called.  It is very sad and beautiful as we recount our outstanding times together, 
and the pain of our separating.  But we know she moves on into a new, productive, 
adventurous life, and we accept it with grace. 
<p>
An hour and a half later, Sabrina takes 20 m.g. of MEM, Jean and I 15 m.g. each.  
There is a very smooth transition into the MEM experience.  In about 15 minutes, we begin to 
feel more power and openness.  We stay in good communication and closeness.  We cannot 
believe it when we observe that two hours have gone by.  
<p>
An hour later we take another capsule of potassium chloride.  Still another hour later, I 
feel very dehydrated and take a third capsule, which resolves the problem.   
<p>
We have a wonderful afternoon, but no profound heights.  In the late afternoon Sabrina 
is experiencing back pains and a headache.  She decides to go to a neighbor to take a hot-tub.  
<p>
I suggest that before she leaves, we try Gendlin's focusing procedure (see Chapter 3, 
Note 9) for her bodily discomforts.  She agrees. 
<p>
She lies down on the couch and goes into it immediately.  I feel strongly guided; the 
procedure flows easily.  I feel much pain in Sabrina.  The handles she chooses are words like 
pain, pressure, dark, block, hold; she moves through them with little resistance.  At the end of 
forty-five minutes I wonder if she has accomplished enough.  She reports that she is 
continually uncovering deeper layers, so we proceed. 
<p>
Suddenly the word "pierce" comes, and she moves into a spontaneous experience.  She 
feels that she is in a past life, and is fleeing with her people from the enemy.  She feels that 
she is masculine, and is either their shaman or their leader.  
<p>
She feels very tired, and that her work is done and that it is time to go.  She stands 
between her people and the enemy, and "calls the lance," which strikes her in the neck.  Her 
people pull her and drag her with them.  She cries, "No, no!" feeling deeply that they don't 
understand, that it is her time to go, and to leave her alone.  They finally comprehend and 
leave her to die, which is a great release.  
<p>
She then goes through a long, dark tunnel, continually asking, "Why is there so much 
pain?"  She sees some light in a circle around the opening of the tunnel; here there is peace.  I 
can feel her resistance dissolving, and the peace and exultation move in.  
<p>
She experiences the very deep pain she feels with her father, being completely 
misunderstood and isolated.  Because her father rejected her, she rejected her father.  Now she 
sees this is senseless revenge, bringing much, much pain to them both.  She gains deep insight 
and understanding of their relationship. 
<p>
Next she finds that it is really true, the body can handle the vast energy from above.  
One doesn't have to leave the body and go to another level for this vitality.  But to handle this 
prodigious energy, one must not let the body dictate, but must direct the energy properly. 
<p>
Sabrina has an enormous release with great peace and euphoria, which invades us all.  I 
feel all of my own load drop as Sabrina moves into this experience of exultation.  A profound 
understanding passes between Sabrina and me.  I feel that at last she truly sees herself and me.  
She expresses that she has felt me with her all the way.  She says, "Midwives need midwives," 
which moves me to tears.  
<p>
From my standpoint, I simply sat quietly, focusing my energy without conceptual 
thought.  As she went through the tunnel, I felt that she needed to learn to shift her focus from 
pain to peace.  I held my focus on peace, and the peace and exultation grew enormously as she 
broke through.  I have no way of knowing whether my silent focusing helped her steer in this 
direction, or whether the increase in peace that I felt simply resulted from her reaching this 
level.  In any event, both Jean and I were lifted to high levels of exultation.  [My current 
understanding, a number of years after this experience, is that the bonding becomes so great in 
these experiences that we are very likely co-experiencing strong feelings.] 
<p>
Following her breakthroughs, Sabrina looks very young.  Her back pains are gone, and 
there is an enormous bond among the three of us.  She still has some headache, for which she 
takes tylenol.  We get further release of deep feelings through dancing to high energy dance 
music. 
<p>
We retire with an enormous feeling of accomplishment.  We can think of no better way 
to help Sabrina embark on her new journey.   
</div>
<p>
<center>
<i>2C-T-2</i>
</center>
<p>
2C-T-2, code name for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine(2), is one of the best 
general purpose psychedelics we have run across.  It is effective over a dose range of 12 to 30 
m.g.  We have occasionally used it at lower doses, 8 to 10 m.g., for the purpose of 
monitoring others taking MDMA, as mentioned in Chapter 3. 
<p>
We found it to be an excellent general purpose work horse.  It retains some of the 
euphoric centering qualities of MDMA, which make it pleasant to work with.  At the same 
time, it provides considerably more opening, similar to the more powerful psychedelics such 
as LSD, without the propensity of the latter to drop one into disturbing pools of repressed 
feelings.  This permits exploring a wide range of levels of thought and inner feelings.  It is a 
long acting substance which can take up an entire day.  The plateau at peak lasts for a good 
five hours, giving one plenty of time to work and enjoy.  
<p>
There is not the driving push from the drug that the classic psychedelics provide, so that 
one retains considerably more volition.  Yet there is sufficient drive to explore any area that is 
truly desired, from one's own feelings to interpersonal relationships to the nature of the 
cosmos.  Motivation is the key.  With practice the earnest seeker can use 2C-T-2 to investigate 
whatever area of consciousness interests her/him.  And for the most part, it is a comfortable, 
enjoyable vehicle with which to do the exploring.  
<p>
Our first experience of 2C-T-2 was with a group of close friends.  I take 14 m.g., Jean 
12 m.g.  The drug is quite gradual in its onset, taking about two hours to reach full intensity.  
<p>
<div class="inset">
As the intensity develops, I develop some of my entry-type discomfort.  Fortunately 
after an hour or so, this dissipates and I enter into a stage of enjoyment.  This is facilitated by 
the bantering and good will of the group.  We all reach a good space, charged with energy.  
This leads to the most enjoyable interchange I have experienced with this group up to this date.  
We find that the chemical has considerably heightened our sense of humor and creativeness to 
have fun.  We also have insightful discussions.  We find it difficult to break up before 
midnight.  
<p>
This experience left me quite whole and well-centered.  The only thing missing is what I 
call the spiritual element, or my feeling the presence of God.  Yet driving home four days later 
I had profound spiritual realizations.  
</div>
<p>
Our first replication of 2C-T-2 without the group came several months later, with the 
same dosage: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
We move into the experience progressing alternatively between positive and negative 
feelings.  We are able to discuss our feelings with each other more freely than ever before.  
We are both aware of our deep anger with each other, and are able to express it without 
rancor.  Jean feels smothered by me, and I see clearly how I do this.  
<p>
I discover within myself a feeling of being "left out," and how painful this is.  I am 
driven to many useless devices to avoid this pain.  As I look at myself through the eyes of my 
friends, I find no qualities that would make them seek my company.  I am able to see this with 
detachment and humor, and am able to laugh at my always striving to be front and center.  I 
try 'feeling wanted' on for size, and this helps me feel better.
<p>
We discuss freedom, and the importance of giving it to each other.  This makes me feel 
a painful loneliness, but is a worthwhile price to pay for granting freedom.  I feel that God is 
very lonely in extending freedom to His people.  But He would never violate the personal 
freedom of others to escape loneliness.  He greatly appreciates those who recognize and 
acknowledge Him.  [I realize that the concept that God can be lonely may violate some 
people's ideas of God.  But as I have deepened my personal relationship with God over the 
years, and comprehend more than ever the vastness of the Mystery that we cannot fathom, I 
still hold to this view.  I personally cherish my anthropomorphic view of God.  While this is a 
very narrow aspect of a vast reality, it is still personally very meaningful to me.  This position 
has at times helped me through some very rough places, as these reports indicate.] 
<p>
Music is powerful, and I reach a magnificent height in which I experience the Supreme 
Female.  She is indescribable beautiful, exquisitely loving, sensitive, tender, nourishing; it is 
worth life itself to be even momentarily in a ray of this magnificent Presence.  I move higher 
to achieve complete union with this Presence.  I feel fear because I am alone, and I'm afraid 
that without the support and relationship of others, I will move into a private, narrow world 
and be totally unconcerned for others.  At this moment Jean enters the room!  I reach heights 
of love and beauty, totally discharging any uncomfortable feelings.
<p>
Despite this, another wave of anger comes over me at the excruciating pain of being 
rejected.  I see that I am rejecting Jean in many ways.  The anger continues to grow, until I 
decide to turn the experience around by consciously creating love.  To do this I find I must be 
very gentle, not forcing it, but allowing the love to build up.  This incorporates the principals I 
had discovered in the Supreme Female.  This brought back all the marvelous feelings of joy, 
beauty, and transcendence I had experienced before.  
</div>
<p>
This experience was remarkably rejuvenating, and felt like a new lease on life.
Here is another experience with a young couple who were undergoing considerable 
difficulty in their relationship.  Joyce and Vern have lived together for five years.  They have 
shared several sacramental journeys, with real growth in understanding.  Vern has a very 
lucrative business installing concrete footings and foundations, but his body is giving out on 
him, so that he is in constant stress and pain.  
<p>
Joyce is fed up with living in an incomplete house, and with what she describes as 
Vern's rigidity, not acknowledging her, being totally immersed in himself and his work, and 
carrying such a huge burden of heaviness that she no longer enjoys being around him.  She 
openly discusses leaving him.  
<p>
We have a long, exploratory discussion to determine whether there is any point in having 
an experience.  Joyce does not want to leave harboring so much resentment and wants to find 
love for herself and Vern.  Vern wishes to drop his heavy burdens and find how to enter a new 
vocation of finishing wood work, which he very much loves. 
<p>
<div class="inset">
We all take 2C-T-2, Joyce and Vern 14 m.g. each, Jean and I 12 m.g.  The intensity 
increases steadily for three hours.  We have easy conversation, covering many aspects of the 
dynamics of life.  Joyce is sharp, alert, and clear-headed, a joy to talk with.  Vern is quiet, 
pleasant, strong, likable, and hard-working.  It is clear he is well over his head, both in the 
relationship and in the projects he is trying to complete without adequate time.  
<p>
At one point we lie down with our heads touching, and listen to a tape.  Both have 
participated in Indian ceremonies, so we choose <i>Sounds of the Shaman</i>.
It is a powerful tape of a highly developed American Indian Shaman producing a variety of intense sounds -- long, 
pronounced deep breathing, rattles, bird cries, evocations.  These sounds are created to 
facilitate moving into unfamiliar states of awareness.  It causes Joyce to confront her fears, and 
she finds herself proceeding from the position of a frightened mouse to an eagle, from the 
untrusting coyote to trust.  
<p>
The rest of the day goes beautifully, with excellent communication, clear insights, and a 
powerful euphoria growing in all of us.  We experience love, trust and gratitude for the 
wonder and beauty of life.  Joyce and Vern reach a point where they feel good being together; 
they have cleared up a great deal of negative material within themselves.  They talk openly and 
honestly, with much greater understanding of each other.  Joyce finds many fine qualities in 
Vern she had been unwilling to see before.  
<p>
Vern feels that he has dropped a heavy load, and can approach his tasks at home with 
renewed energy, fresh attitudes and understanding.  He now feels that the stress of their 
deteriorating relationship may be partially responsible for his body problems.  He finds that he 
is enjoying concrete work more than he had realized.  However, he does want to get out of 
this hard physical labor.  
<p>
They left the next day much happier, freer, and with a great deal more understanding 
and willingness to confront their situation.  Joyce is not sure if she will stay, but at least she 
will leave knowing that she loves Vern.  
<p>
Jean and I both had an excellent experience.  We learned to surmount our own personal 
concerns and thereby be better companions for others struggling with problems.  Joyce found 
2C-T-2 excellent to work with.  It allowed her to look into the dark places without pushing 
her.  She knew she had the choice to turn away if she wished, but her honesty compelled her 
to get as much as possible from the experience.
</div>
<p>
Continued use of 2C-T-2 revealed many valuable properties.  We gained a great deal of 
experience with this substance personally, and with a number of subjects.  A more formal 
investigation was conducted with the first time use of 40 subjects, and is reported in the 
reference of Chapter 3, Note 3.
<p>
<center>
<i>2C-T-7</i>
</center>
<p>
2C-T-7, code name for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylthiophenethylamine(3),
is another one of the outstanding phenethylamine compounds.  In many respects it is very similar to 2C-T-2.  
It has the same dose range, although there have been occasions where 10 m.g was quite 
powerful and adequate.  It takes about two hours to reach full intensity, has a broad, 
approximately five hour plateau of full activity, and has a long, gradual descent.  There is 
evidence that it is even more euphoric than 2C-T-2.  Several of our subjects who experienced 
dark regions with 2C-T-2 discovered 2C-T-7 to be continually enjoyable.  Here is the report of 
our first trial with 2C-T-7: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
We each start with 12 m.g.  Not much is happening, so an hour and a half later, Jean 
takes an additional 3 m.g. and I add 8 m.g.  I spend most of the day releasing to my Inner 
Teacher.  I clear up a deep charge of loneliness.  Later I find it satisfying to respond 
immediately to inner impulses without squelching them.  I do some neglected repair work on 
power lines feeding our pump house.  Using a hacksaw, I learn how tense and compulsive I 
am, and how much better things work by relaxing and letting the universe cooperate.  
<p>
Later, relaxing on the deck, my thinking is free and clear.  My previous chore 
demonstrated the power of focusing the mind.  I now focus on love, with most rewarding 
results.  Vestiges of discomfort clear up.  I see the great value of holding love in the face of 
diversity.  I get a powerful insight:  let any feeling of discomfort remind me of the wonder, 
beauty, and bountifulness of the universe.  This works much better than my habitual response, 
which is to wonder what is wrong.  
<p>
I discover my strong desire for POWER, and how wonderful it feels to permit it to 
course through my being.  I have worked hard to hide this realization from myself.  As I share 
this with Jean, she says "Of course!" as if to say, what else is new?  "Power is useful, but it 
must always be used with love."
<p>
I see I still hold restrictions on Jean.  As I relinquish them, I can freely explore various 
dimensions of her being.  This is enormously rewarding.  We agree to drop our restrictions on 
each other and be true friends.
<p>
I get the clearest realization yet of how everything I look at is part of me.  I have no 
sense of self-boundary.  Everything exists to help us if we can just let it in.  Wonder and 
beauty are everywhere.  I don't need to manipulate anything; just letting things be is ultimate 
satisfaction.
</div>
<p>
This experience relieved me of much burden I was carrying, permitting me to function 
more effectively.  I am much more able to stay focused on my writing.  I have lost my sense 
of impatience while doing menial tasks. Also, some arthritis in my thumb that was threatening 
to become chronic disappeared.  I feel this is an excellent substance, very clear, very 
permissive, and easier on the body than 2C-T-2. 
<p>
A month later:
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean takes 18 m.g. of 2C-T-7; I take 20 m.g.  Jean becomes very intoxicated, very much 
enjoying the experience.  We have excellent communication, sharing our resentments of each 
other and what we wish of our partner that we have not been receiving.  We find that we each 
have withheld many private thoughts from each other.  Our discussion clears up many areas of 
misunderstanding, but most importantly, yields a marvelous feeling of inner freedom. I 
discover that a lot of the psychic burden I carry is "withholds" -- things I think and feel but 
don't verbalize.  Declaring what is on my mind produces a wonderful sense of freedom.
<p>
We reach an intensity of enjoyment beyond what we have previously experienced 
together.  We deeply feel our love for each other, and greatly appreciate the enchantment of 
our surroundings.  The beauty grows with focused appreciation.  I find the secret is "to let 
God live;" to allow His presence at all times in whatever we are doing.  Jean and I commit 
ourselves to maintaining this outstanding space of love and clear communication.
</div>
<p>
Despite the closeness developed in these experiences, difficulties arose in Jean's and my 
relationship.  Continued work exposed ever deeper layers of anger and self-hatred, which we 
projected on each other.  Jean, never deeply involved in self-awareness, was confronted with a 
variety of new feelings.  And despite my becoming more loving, my improved perceptions 
resulted in me becoming more critical and frustrated.  I also believed that I had done all that I 
could to resolve my own feelings, and that I could not find comfort unless Jean resolved her 
resentments, which seemed unlikely. 
<p>
We reached a breaking point and decided to part.  But we had planned to attend a 
weekend retreat at Sky High Ranch, and agreed to complete this before any final decisions.  
As it turned out, we both received a good deal of valuable counseling there, which convinced 
us that our miserable feelings were of our own creation.  This resulted in a decision to make 
our relationship work.  The following experience followed shortly after this: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean takes 18 m.g. of 2C-T-7, I take 20 m.g.  We spend a good deal of time clarifying 
communication, agreeing on household procedures, reviewing our histories, discussing her 
mother and her dislike for me.  Many things come to light, but Jean is very uncomfortable.  
There is a heavy weight between us.
<p>
We listen to music, and we are carried away.  I see we can open up to the universe, 
leave the gritty stuff behind, and look for the best of all possible worlds.  This means seeing 
the highest in each other, acknowledging, supporting, and empowering each other.
<p>
My experience completely turns around, and the heaviness evaporates into love.  I see 
Jean totally differently.  There is an infinite source of love to draw upon, and there is no such 
thing as tiredness.  Energy and love are always available.  The first commandment resounds 
through me, in its utter, full dimensions.  I fully comprehend what it means to love God with 
 <i>all</i> my heart and 
 <i>all</i> my soul and 
 <i>all</i> my strength and 
 <i>all</i> my mind.  It is mind-boggling, an incomprehensible love.  
<p>
I look around at the sky and the mountains, and ask to see what is the true nature of 
reality if I do absolutely nothing to influence it.  A great euphoria begins to quietly build.  I do 
nothing to encourage it, but simply keep observing.  An enormous power grows within, and 
everything is filled with light.  I see that my concept of the Central Power Source is accurate.  
Focusing on this creates some tensions in my body.  These have been formed by previous 
striving, and are now surfacing into awareness.  As I observe the tensions and release them as 
with vipassana breath meditation, they dissipate.  Everything flows together in the 
extraordinary space of pure, harmonious existence.
<p>
All the difficulties with Jean have evaporated, and we enjoy an outstanding closeness and 
harmony.  I see her at times with a remarkable inner beauty shining forth, the manifestation 
of her Celestial nature, which simply melts me in love.
</div>
<p>
This experience cemented the change in our relationship.  While it was not the end of 
our differences or our difficulties, it brought a determination on both of our parts to make our 
relationship work. 
<p>
Jean and I reaped a great deal of personal benefit from 2C-T-7.  We observed its use on 
numerous occasions with others, which confirmed our assessment of the value of this 
compound.  The more formal study of 2C-T-2 described above included seven subjects who 
took 2C-T-7. 
<p>
<center>
<i>Limited Experience</i>
</center>
<p>
Of the remaining substances we have tried on a limited basis, there are a few that are 
worth mentioning because of their interesting potential.  These are described below. 
<p>
<center>
<i>2C-T-21</i>
</center>
<p>
2C-T-21, code name for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)phenethylamine(4),
is a very interesting substance, quite different from the other psychoactive drugs.  In fact, it is not 
psychedelic, but a wonderful energizer.  It raises mood and spirit, raises the energy level, 
increases wit and sense of humor, facilitates communication, and in general provides an 
excellent good time.  All of this with no sacrifice in appetite.  Most of the other active 
compounds tend to be anorectic during their active period.  In short, it produces the state that 
most people are looking for when they drink alcohol, but without drunkenness or depressing 
any other faculties.  There is no hangover, but instead a reasonable amount of bodily 
rejuvenation.  So it is a laudable compound for group enjoyment when no serious work is 
intended. 
<p>
Jean and I have enjoyed a number of excellent sessions with friends using this chemical.  
I was curious to see what the results would be when I took it alone: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
I feel greater intensity than with the group.  Looking inside, I find I can examine issues, 
and look at several.  The most interesting is examining my concept of the Central Furnace.  
This is my understanding that the center of our being is our essence where life energy 
manifests, and it is through this life energy that we are connected to all others and the rest of 
creation.  My experience is that as you approach this core, you discover a brilliant, 
penetrating, overpowering light of indescribable beauty.  This is love itself, or God, residing 
at our central core.  This is what I call the Central Furnace.
<p>
In this experience, I get a sense of it, and attempt to intensify it.  As I do this, it seems 
to me that I simultaneously intensify Hell, as Heaven and Hell must stay in balance.  So it is 
better to achieve some transcendent level that integrates them both.  
<p>
But four days later, I have to revise my evaluation.  I have a lasting feeling of a central, 
interior warmth within myself.  This was produced by my willingness to concentrate on the 
Central Furnace for some time.  Giving it my attention helped to bring it into reality.  
<p>
Now I see no harm in doing this.  In fact, it produced a considerable benefit.  As I now 
understand it, if it is attempted out of one's willful determination, the result is as first 
described.  Willfully attempting to create the positive automatically creates its counterpart, the 
negative.  Now it seems clear that the proper procedure is to focus, or ask, and then let the 
development come from a deeper source within, which takes surrender.  This clearly seems the 
way to become Co-Creator.  [This ties in with my concept of being partners with God, a view 
that runs through most of my major experiences.]
</div>
<p>
2C-T-21 permits bending to some extent to individual exploration, but is far surpassed in 
this regard by many other compounds.  Its most satisfying use appears to be in group situations 
as described above. 
<p>
A word of caution:  One experienced couple we know fell into a dark, frightening hole 
with this compound.  They were convinced that it is toxic.  It is extremely important to 
remember that when working with these substances, there is no such thing as a casual 
experiment.  One must always have recourse to knowledge and skillful means, and always be 
prepared for unexpected eruptions of the unconscious mind.  As far as I know, no one else 
has reported a similar difficulty with 2C-T-21.
<p>
<center>
<i>2C-T-4</i>
</center>
<p>
2C-T-4, code name for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(i)-propylthiophenethylamine,
has characteristics quite similar to 2C-T-2 except that it is considerably longer acting.  We have 
had it only twice, and our first experience with it was outstanding.  We found it more benign 
than 2C-T-2, perhaps because lasting all day and evening, the intensity of the chemical grew 
more gradu
ally and was easier to handle.  We found it a superb way to put in a long day.  
Here is a report of our first trial: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean takes 8 m.g. and I take 9 m.g. of 2C-T-4.  We have a marvelous ascent -- clean, 
gentle, and smooth.  Our perception is heightened, and conversation is easy.  We enjoy talking 
over many things for which we ordinarily don't take time.
<p>
I spend a good deal of time exploring inside, which is very rewarding.  It is easy to 
explore questions and find answers.  I strike a deep loneliness, which resolves as my love for 
myself grows.  I focus on self-love until I finally break free with a substantial appreciation of 
myself.  This is most fulfilling.
<p>
The experience grows in intensity over a three hour period, and stays at the peak for 
many hours afterward.  It becomes a complete, profound, and thorough exploration. This is a 
remarkable substance, allowing me to look anywhere and explore any chosen subject.  
Bodywise, it is clean and clear.  The experience remains smooth and gentle.  Even exploring 
uncomfortable areas, there is still a good feeling tone.  I see clearly into my own functioning, 
relationships, the dynamics of people I focus on, and general philosophical truths.  
<p>
I find it best to let go and simply flow with the experience, following wherever it takes 
me.  This leads to a growing euphoria, a feeling of clearing out body residues, and often 
culminates in profound insight.  Thinking continues to grow in clarity throughout the day, and 
visual perception is crystal clear.  The scenery is outstanding.  Closeness and understanding 
with Jean develop steadily during the day.  It is a most enjoyable time together.  
<p>
A major problem I work on is the sluggish feelings that arise from time to time.  I find it 
best to simply ride them through.  As the day develops, it becomes easier to change my 
feelings by changing the focus of my thoughts.  A major lesson is honesty, to simply be what I 
am with all of my idiosyncrasies, and stop trying to make things different.  I achieve an 
exceptional state of peace and contentment with myself and the way things are.
<p>
Dancing to high energy dance music uncovers a lot of new, intense feelings, leading to 
some of the most profound realizations of the day.  I strike a profound dichotomy:  on the one 
hand, everyone is God and can resolve their own burdens, so I don't have to do anything.  On 
the other hand, I am Christ and only by my being willing to lift the burden of others can the 
world be helped.  [This is somewhat like a high level realization I experienced sometime later 
with my friend Gil (see Chapter 11), that the highest state of all is caring with all of your 
might, while simultaneously not caring with all of your might.  Whoever comprehends this is 
well along the path!]
<p>
I see there is nothing wrong with having high standards, as long as I apply them to 
myself.  I profoundly see the equality of everyone, and my proper relationship to others.
</div>
<p>
Persons on tight time schedules will have a hard time working in the occasion for 2C-T-4.
Jean and I like setting aside a day for an experience, and that being the case, it might as 
well be a full one!  This substance certainly offered us a rich, full, extremely rewarding day.
<p>
<center>
<i>2C-T-8</i>
</center>
<p>
Every once in a while a new compound comes down the pike which is particularly 
outstanding, the greatly sought-after elixir that produces the +4 experience (see Appendix II 
for rating scale definitions).  One never knows whether it is the special properties of the 
compound, the psychic state and disposition of the subject, a fortunate combination of 
environment and companions, a particular combination of individual body chemistry and the 
compound, or some composite of the above.  But on the occasion of my one and only trial 
with 2C-T-8, all of the necessary factors were present for a memorable, outstanding 
experience.
<p>
2C-T-8, code name for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyclopropylmethylthiophenethylamine(6),
is a long-acting phenethylamine compound less potent than 2C-T-2 or 2C-T-7.  Here is a report of 
our first experience: 
<p>
<div class="inset">
Jean takes 39 m.g. of 2C-T-8, I take 40 m.g.  While waiting for developments, I decide 
to work on the novel I have been writing.  For several days I have been blocked, and not able 
to produce anything. I become aware of many facets of the characters and the possibilities that 
could open up in their lives.  Also, of many twists and turns the plot can take.  I have enough 
material to keep me writing for days!
<p>
The day continues remarkably.  I feel exceptionally good, there is no trace of "below the 
line," the customary sludginess I always have to work through, and I achieve a state of 
monumental insight and understanding.  This is a real awakening, as though I had never before 
known how to properly use these compounds.  
<p>
I see myself as a fantastic computer.  I am infinite being, with all resources contained in 
my vastness.  Anything I wish to see is like pressing the keys on a computer keyboard to call 
up a particular file.  In this case, the key is the focus of my attention.  As I hold a central 
thought in my mind it unfolds, revealing the contents of the file.  I have an absolutely 
marvelous time for several hours operating my computer, examining various concepts.  Some 
of the key words I focus on are:
<p>
a. Love.  As I look at Jean to feel my love for her, I realize that loving is not just seeing 
God at the core of the person -- God is part of the whole being, including the ego and all the 
person's idiosyncrasies.  As Jean moves around, I delight in watching every little movement.  
As I direct love at myself, I encounter a lot of resistance.  I keep holding love, and come to 
peace with much of myself.  At one point I get a glimpse of my soul, or Anima -- that 
fantastically beautiful Feminine Presence that is a figure of radiance and light which fills 
everything with wonder.  
<p>
I find the title of Jampolsky's book <i>Love is Letting Go of Fear</i> an excellent guide.
By replacing with love the initial fear I often feel when I release to explore inside, the fear 
dissipates and indeed turns to love.  This is also a good way to deal with anger.  
<p>
b.  Peace.  A most wondrous thing to feel out and experience.
<p>
c.  Gratitude.  Gratitude is certainly a major key to life.  When observing with gratitude, 
it affirms the beauty and reality of the focus of attention.  This in turn reveals more depth to 
be grateful for.  Which increases gratitude.  This rises to incredible heights of experience, and 
floods through all aspects of life.  Marvelous, marvelous.  Being grateful for Jean, I discover 
that she is a perfect partner for me.  
<p>
d.  Jean.  Jean has gone through a struggle of whether she wanted to live or die.  She is 
terribly afraid of being alone.  We are able to talk very openly and honestly.  We are 
extremely grateful to be with each other, and to share this experience just with the two of us.  
We acknowledge our need for each other.  She is doing very honest work, going deeply and 
comprehensively into her feelings.
<p>
As we discuss loneliness, we confirm that once we discover our true inner being we are 
never alone.  Yet there is great joy and wonder in being with and sharing energy with others.  
We realize that we do a lot to shut each other out.  This ultimately builds a wall within us 
which shuts us off from life.  We agree to stay open to each other.  
<p>
When Jean goes to the studio to paint, I find loneliness creep in.  I define myself as 
confident, able, and enjoying my work.  I soon feel a wonderful sense of freedom.  I release 
my dependence on having other people around.  I now enjoy being at my computer while Jean 
is in the studio painting.
<p>
e.  Prostate.  As I examine my prostate difficulty, I see my problem is not properly 
handling waste.  This is symbolized by not being able to empty my bladder.  I pick up a lot of 
psychic garbage in life, as well as physical junk I have a hard time throwing away.  I resolve 
to dispose of waste.  [Several years later, while I have made quite a bit of progress, I still need 
to be much tougher on this score!]  
<p>
f.  Anger.  In my meditation the following morning, I am surprised to run into 
monumental anger.  I find this stems from being deprived of intimacy.  I generate even more 
anger by trying to convince myself that I don't really need intimacy and can exist self-sufficiently.
I feel a great deal of benefit from discharging this anger and replacing it with 
love.  It seems clear that holding back anger could well be responsible for the swelling of the 
prostate gland.  An interesting item to research.
</div>
<p>
This has been a most productive experience, and at the same time was free of 
discomfort.  Therefore we were surprised to hear that with other experimenters there were as 
many negatives as positives.  2C-T-8 consequently has not been actively pursued.  I am left 
with the dilemma of how I can have such a remarkable experience on a substance that many 
others find unsatisfactory!
